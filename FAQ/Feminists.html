<h1>Gender, Feminists</h1>

<matrika:video clip="/Clips/Clip7_BabyStuck.video" width="384" height="288" />

<h2>Aren&rsquo;t these traditions anti-woman?</h2>

<p>
Most feminists agree that freedom of choice and reproductive rights
should be a part of any women&rsquo;s health agenda. However MATRIKA is
concerned that this agenda does not include women&rsquo;s right to
choose &lsquo;tradition&rsquo; and indigenous healing and birthing
modalities.
</p>

<p>
While it is important to champion all women&rsquo;s rights to access
biomedical health services, it is also important that we do not de-skill
ourselves as caretakers of our own and our families&rsquo; health. For
this reason we need to acknowledge and respect the valuable
contributions of women&rsquo;s indigenous health knowledge and practice.
Whatever form it takes &ndash; in North India a grandmother makes a hot
concoction of mulati and ginger; a dai gives a woman ajwain ka ladoo or
pangiri postpartum &ndash; these healing practices are still in memory.
They will be erased, however, if their valuable contributions are not
acknowledged. Cultural resources are being discarded. The question is
how do we take the best from both tradition and modern medicine?
</p>

<p>Indigenous health practices, which are often household-based, are still
surviving, unsupported by state and biomedical establishments, due to
their abiding relevance to local communities. Insufficient knowledge
about indigenous medicines and their therapeutic capacities has led the
women&rsquo;s health movement to advocate for more hospital care,
emergency services, more chemical medicines and contraceptives,
disregarding the wealth of alternatives coming from traditions. It is
important for all women to take charge of their own health and not be
dependent on doctors or other health professionals. We should not lose
our living heritage of herbs, massage and ritual practice &ndash; nor
should we be denied access to good modern medical care.

<blockquote>
	Generally speaking, women in India find
	more resonance in the AYUSH systems and local health traditions as
	compared to Allopathy. This is because of their pattern of social and
	cultural relationships, their power (or lack of it) within each system,
	and the way women relate to their bodies and to nature. Contrary to
	what most analysts have argued, it is probably not their powerlessness
	(economic weakness, poor educational status) that &quot;drives&quot;
	women (as it is said) to vaidyas or hakims. As regards mental and
	emotional health, too, there is more resonance. In the Allopathic view
	there is a sharp mind/body distinction or split, hence a dichotomy of
	mind and emotions. The male mind (supposedly not emotional) is seen as
	the standard &quot;sound mind&quot;, and so women's mental and
	emotional health issues tend to get discounted. But in the traditional
	views, in general found throughout India, a person's &quot;man&quot;
	(roughly translating as &quot;mind&quot; but located closer to the
	heart, in the upper chest) is a combination of both mental and
	emotional facets. This is not to say that women&rsquo;s mental health
	issues are not neglected by practitioners of Ayurveda, Unani or
	Homeopathy. It is only to suggest that the AYUSH systems and local
	health traditions may provide relatively more space for women&rsquo;s
	mental health issues to be addressed.

<h2>Why is there so much misinformation about dais and birth traditions?</h2>

<p>
During British colonial times Western science and medicine were viewed
as superior to Indian knowledge systems such as Ayurveda, Yoga, Tantra,
etc. Also gender relations and the status of women in India were used as
justifications for colonial rule. The following quotes come from
Katherine Mayo in Mother India, (first published in 1925) a book which
influenced the Indian elite of the time.
</p>

<p>
<em>Says Dr. N.N. Parakh, the Indian physician:</em>
</p>

<p>Ignorance and the purdah system have brought the women of India to the
level of animals. They are unable to look after themselves, nor have
they any will of their own. They are slaves to their masculine owners.
</p>

<p>
Said that outstanding Swarajist leader Lala Lajpat Rai, in his
Presidential address to the Hindu Mahasabha Conference held in Bombay in
December, 1925:
</p>

<p>
The great feature of present day Hindu life is passivity. &ldquo;Let it
be so &rdquo; sums up all their psychology, individual and social. They
have got into the habit of taking things lying down. They have imbibed
this tendency and this psychology and this habit from their
mothers&#8230;There is nothing so hateful as a quarrelsome,
unnecessarily assertive, impudent, ill-mannered woman, but even if that
were the only road which the Hindu woman must traverse in order to be an
efficient, courageous, independent and physically fit mother, I would
prefer it to the existing state of things.

<h2>What about the idea that birth and menstruation are &lsquo;dirty&rsquo;?</h2>

<p>
It is very tempting for modern women to stand outside of ideas of the
&lsquo;dirty&rsquo; female body and critique them as archaic and
misogynist. Considering the MATRIKA data and focusing a woman-centered
eye on India&rsquo;s extensive and ancient visual culture cautions us
against doing so.
</p>

<p>
Dais&rsquo; voices suggest that this &lsquo;dirt&rsquo; correlates
closely to the fertility of the earth and of the female body. So-called
&lsquo;pollution taboos&rsquo; are related to this female
fertility &ndash; where priests have radically separated the idea of the
sacred from the reproductive potential of the female body. This is true
of all the dominant religions: Judeo-Christian-Islamic and Brahmanical
Hinduism. During menstruation and post-birth women are
&lsquo;unclean&rsquo;. However the dai speaks with a very different
voice than the pundit about this uncleanness. To her the placenta, the
ultimate polluting substance in the shastra literature, is spoken of
reverently. It is no coincidence that dais are mainly from low and
outcaste communities. Both caste and gender are involved in concepts of
the &lsquo;dirty&rsquo;.
</p>

</span>

<p>
Despite the pejorative connotations, this concept has allowed for
abiding female spaces and birth cultures. In the &lsquo;male&rsquo; or
&lsquo;dominant&rsquo; view these female times are &lsquo;filthy&rsquo;
or polluted, but they are also times when masculine, social and even
familial demands on women are suspended. Both fertile women and fertile
land must rest, in order to create the world anew. And traditionally
older women guarded these spaces from any incursions &ndash; perhaps with
the help of &lsquo;demons&rsquo; and nether forces!? Within this
imagistic representation, the nature of female bodily energy is
understood as &lsquo;out of control&rsquo; &ndash; women are presumed to
be more emotional and have special physical needs at this time &ndash; so
the usual social constraints are suspended. Of course we need to
question the priestly voice and de-sacralisation of menstruation and
birth &ndash; but we should not throw out the baby with the bathwater. We
should not ignore traditional birth knowledge.

<h2>
	How can we who are concerned about gender and the politics of
	knowledge understand the gender biases of modern medicine?
</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Science and modern knowledge systems were developed in 17th
		Century Europe among a group of elite men, outside of the
		Universities, that were controlled by the Church. They explicitly and
		implicitly excluded women for 300 years. (And also lower class men and
		men of color.)
	</li>
	<li>In England the Royal Society was founded in 1660 and the first
		woman was admitted in 1945.
	</li>
	<li>In the United States Smith College was founded in 1875 as the
		first educational institution which followed the same curriculum as
		men&rsquo;s elite Ivy League colleges to which women had no access. At
		the time of its founding, the dean of the Harvard medical school
		published a book in which he argued that a rigorous intellectual
		curriculum would shrivel a woman&rsquo;s uterus since all her blood
		would have to go to her brain.
	</li>
	<li>One characteristic of this system was that it depended on a
		new world view &ndash; one in which the non-human world was
		machine-like, had no consciousness or agency. God was understood to be
		the creator of the world, likened to a master clockmaker of an inert
		and unconscious universe. God wound up the clock and gave it its
		working rules, the &ldquo;laws of nature &rdquo;.
	</li>
	<li>Human beings (male) endowed with a God-like mind could figure
		out the rules &ndash; they are called the &lsquo;laws of nature&rsquo;.
	</li>
	<li>Spirit or soul was removed from nature &ndash; nature was inert
		and nature and culture were totally separate, becoming categories that
		are mutually exclusive in the sense that culture is what nature is not
		and nature is what culture is not.
	</li>
	<li>According to Boyd, the father of the scientific experimental
		method, God could create and annihilate but Nature could do neither.
		Thus experimental science was fully legitimated to act upon nature.
		Women could not participate in these experiments since women were
		equated with nature.
	</li>
	<li>These changes in worldview overlapped with the
		&lsquo;Enclosure movement&rsquo; &ndash; land being enclosed and
		privately owned. Before many people had rights to land. The European
		&lsquo;commons&rsquo; was the material foundation of peasant social
		life. Land became a &lsquo;resource&rsquo; and peasants were removed
		by the &lsquo;owners&rsquo;. Livelihoods, social life, sacredness of
		land were all eroded.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>&ldquo;The Age of Reason was Built on the Ashes of European Shamanesses &rdquo;</h2>

<ul>
	<li>The emergence of this knowledge system corresponded with the
		witchhunts (most of whom were women) and the persecution of other
		&lsquo;heretics&rsquo;. In Europe these were bloody centuries, full of
		religious and class wars. There was a prominence of women in the
		peasant rebellions.
	</li>
	<li>In the German city of Cologne during the religious wars nearly
		all the midwives were executed. Women accused of witchcraft were often
		midwives and healers as well as shamanesses using local psychotropic
		plants.
	</li>
	<li>The wise women (in French Sage Fem, in Hindi
		Samajwali &ndash; she who knows) lived in local communities mostly
		practicing subsistence agriculture. They articulated the agency of the
		non-human world through expressions of gratitude, reciprocity,
		language of the spirit, as well as gift exchange.
	</li>
	<li>Nature&rsquo;s powers of Regeneration were not separate from
		human regeneration. Psychotropic substances, communication with the
		dead, rituals all facilitated regeneration.
	</li>
	<li>In the earlier worldview there was a world soul, Anima Mundi,
		and all of matter was full of life. The world was full of God. The
		five elements (the panchmahabhuta) linked the human and non-human
		world.
	</li>
	<li>The shaman &ndash; plant &ndash; ritual &ndash; forest or jungle all
		co-created each other in this cosmovision.
	</li>
</ul>
