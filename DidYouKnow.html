<h1>Did You know the meaning of <em>Yoni</em>?</h1>

<p>
	The vagina, the entry to the womb, is most often represented in today&lsquo;s
	world in dry, schematic biomedical parlance, or in gross, often
	exploitative pornography. Increasingly women are reclaiming this part of
	our bodies in terms of our own pleasure and fertility. Here we offer
	imagings of the opening from which babies emerge.
</p>

<p>
	The root of &lsquo;yoni&rsquo; is the Sanskrit word &lsquo;yuj&rsquo; meaning &lsquo;to unite&rsquo;. 
	The yoni is the crucible where things are combined (male and female, mother
	and fetus) &ndahs; where creation and re-creation takes place. Where the unseen
	(not perceptible to the senses) world takes material form.
</p>

<p>
	The yoni is also the place where each menstruating woman, may within her
	body, experience the cosmic cycles of creation sustenance and
	destruction. Each month the egg is released by the ovary, finds its way
	through the fallopian tube, and may or may not be fertilized, the birth,
	life and death of an egg cell.
</p>

<p>
	Yoni signifies both vagina and womb. In the traditional cosmo-vision it
	is where the spirit world (or the unborn, the ancestors) meet the
	flesh-and-blood reality of the material world.
