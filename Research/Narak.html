		<span class="default">MATRIKA (Motherhood and Traditional
			Resources, Information, Knowledge, and Action) was a 3-year
			participatory action research project in collaboration with four
			local NGOs during the years 1998-2001. MATRIKA is named after a group
			of female figures, usually either seven or eight, depicted in
			sculpture and myth as collective and semi-divine beings &ndash; and
			associated with mothering. The Matrika images include voluptuous
			beauties &ndash; one with an infant, theriomorphic (human body with
			animal head) figures and a wizened crone (for more detail see
			Panniker, 1997).</span>

		We drew up collaboration agreements with Action India (working in the
		slums of Delhi); Mahila Jagriti Kendra (South Bihar); Voluntary Health
		Association of Punjab (Fategarh District) and URMUL
		(Rajasthan) &ndash; in order to generate material that would be of use
		to the NGO as well as our own interests. The NGO then called together
		dais who were considered by local women to be experienced and
		knowledgeable for a series of three workshops. In these workshops we
		posed the question &#8216;what does a woman need during pregnancy,
		birth and postpartum?&rsquo;<br /> Our initial methodology was
		derived from counselling &ndash; usually practiced in a one-to-one
		setting &ndash; which we transposed to our workshops. &#8216;Active
		listening,&rsquo; when practiced by the interviewer or facilitator,
		allows the person (or group) to speak in a non-directed
		manner &ndash; with topics emerging from the informant/s rather than
		using a questionnaire with a specific agenda. Active listening also
		involves feeding back what has been understood by the researchers in
		order to allow the group/person to go deeper into the subject or
		refine or correct misunderstandings. Secondly, positive reinforcement
		involves recognising and appreciating behaviour which seems to the
		listener to have contributed to the speaker&rsquo;s own well being or
		the well being of those around her &ndash; particularly if gender or
		caste bias is involved. For example, if the family were biased towards
		the male children then protecting taking care of a girl infant or
		child would be actively appreciated.

	<p>We realized that often dais have been made scapegoats for
		maternal mortality and morbidity and blamed for the effects of other
		macro-level processes. MATRIKA&rsquo;s workshop methodology reversed
		the common TBA training model. We asked groups of dais to &#8216;train
		us&rsquo; by seeking to understand what they thought about and did to
		meet women&rsquo;s needs during parturition.</p>
	<p>
		Our activities included role-plays, ritual drawings, body mapping,
		singing of birth songs, sharing of birth experiences (ours and theirs)
		as well as dais&rsquo; life narratives. . Group discussions,
		interpreting role-plays and other data, were at the heart of our
		activities. The lower-level NGO health workers were invaluable in
		helping us to understand the material we were receiving. Mostly drawn
		from local communities themselves, they, when given permission from
		those with &#8216;authority&rsquo; would explain and elaborate on the
		&#8216;data.&rsquo; We were able to access, and remain with, this
		alien (to us) information because we did not limit ourselves by
		separating data into mutually exclusive categories of
		&#8216;medicine&rsquo; and &#8216;religion&rsquo;. Rather we were
		receptive to diverse ways of facilitating birth, diagnosing and
		healing &ndash; to ritual enactments, notions of deities and demons, <em>bhut-pret</em>
		(ghosts and spirits) and the nazar or evil eye. We attempted to let
		the data speak the categories rather than the categories shape the
		data. <br /> <br /> <br /> <span class="lrgtxt2">MATRIKA
			Findings</span>

	<p>At first, of course, dais seemed to want to impress us with
		their knowledge of the modern, biomedical approach. They spoke of the
		need for using a clean blade, taking the woman to the hospital if
		there were problems (when often there no doctors or hospitals in the
		area). But as our sincere desire to learn and not &#8216;teach&rsquo;
		or criticize became apparent &ndash; and especially after our own
		enactments of the loneliness and confusion of a woman laboring alone
		in a hospital &ndash; they began to trust us and share what they really
		believed and practiced. Ours was a collective effort: a group of
		researcher-activists interacting with a group of dais. We ate, slept,
		talked, sang and danced, produced drawings and plays together. Our
		workshop activities were a celebration of dais cultural handling of
		childbirth. We were sometimes told that no one had ever called them
		together to share and enjoy like this.</p>

			other areas the meanings are more implicit in the practices and the
			&#8216;dirtiness&rsquo; associated with times of female fertility.</span>

			The marriage of a young girl, who has not had her periods, is

			narak period ends. The Dai checks if the umbilical cord has fallen
			off. Then she bathes the baby and beats a thaali (plate). After this
			the woman is bathed and wears new clothes. The dai cleans the room
			where the delivery took place and the woman was kept separately for
			six days. The dirty clothes of mother and child are washed. After

		<span class="lrgtxt2">The conflation of the female body and the
			earth &ndash; Reclaiming narak </span>
	</p>
	<p class="default">It is very tempting for us modern women to stand
		outside of ideas of the &#8216;dirty&rsquo; female body and critique
		them as archaic and misogynist. Having listened carefully to
		dais&rsquo; voices, and paid attention to Indian, indeed
		sub-continental representation systems for almost 30 years I am now
		adamantly against doing so.</p>
	<p class="default">
		Although often translated as hellish or demonic place, narak can be
		understood as the site or energy of the unseen inner world - of the
		earth and of the body, particularly the fertile and bleeding female
		body. <em>Narak</em> has the connotation &#8216;filth&rsquo; but also
		signifies the fertility or fruitful potential of the earth and woman.
		So-called &#8216;pollution taboos&rsquo; are related to<em> narak</em> &ndash; where
		the idea of the sacred is radically separated from the reproductive
		potential of the female body. During menstruation and post-birth women
		are &#8216;unclean&rsquo;. However the dai speaks with a very
		different voice than the pundit about this uncleanness, this <em>narak</em>.
		To her the placenta, the ultimate polluting substance in the shastra
		literature, is spoken of reverently. It is no coincidence that dais
		are mainly from low and outcaste communities. Both caste and gender
		are involved in concepts of <em>narak</em>.
	</p>
	<p class="default">Despite the pejorative connotations of the word
		narak, the concept has allowed for abiding female spaces and birth
		cultures. In the &#8216;male&rsquo; or &#8216;dominant&rsquo; view
		these female times are &#8216;filthy&rsquo; or polluted, but they are
		also times when masculine, social and even familial demands on women
		are suspended. And traditionally older women guarded these spaces from
		any incursions &ndash; perhaps with the help of &#8216;demons&rsquo; and
		nether forces!? Within this imagistic representation, the nature of
		female bodily energy is understood as &#8216;out of
		control&rsquo; &ndash; women are presumed to be more emotional and have
		special physical needs at this time &ndash; so the usual social
		constraints are suspended. Of course we need to interrogate the
		priestly voice and de-sacralisation of menstruation and
		birth &ndash; but we should not throw out the baby with the bathwater.
		We should not ignore the traditional birth knowledge of India.</p>
	<p class="default">Conversely the fertility of land and woman are
		acknowledged and honored. Both are &#8216;fruitful&rsquo; and this is
		not simply a symbolic device. Within indigenous medical traditions
		such as Ayurveda, and with the dais, a totally different ontological
		system is at work. Woman is not a &#8216;symbol&rsquo; of the earth.
		Nor is the earth a &#8216;symbol&rsquo; of woman. Rather they both
		partake of the same nature of fecundity. Just as the wind outside my
		window partakes of the same essence as the breath which flows in and
		out of my lungs.</p>
	<p class="default">
		During <em>narak</em> time what is usually closed, the womb, is open,
		raw, vulnerable and bleeding. <em>Narak</em> allows for the imaging of
		the unseen &ndash; and the use of other senses, besides the visual, as
		well as the human capacities of empathy and imagination in diagnostics
		and therapeutics. And in fact narak is deeply implicated in the
		handling of postpartum care.
	</p>
	<p class="default" style="margin-left: 30px">
		After delivery a woman is not given any grain or heavy food. This is
		called <em>narak</em> fasting. Grain is only given on the third day
		after all the dirty blood comes out. On first day, she eats biscuits
		with tea. She drinks warm water. Second day, heat-producing balls made
		out of ginger, pepper, turmeric, roasted rice, milk and jaggery (<em>saunth
			laddos</em>). On the third day, rice, dal and vegetables. &quot; (Bihar)
	</p>
	<p class="default" style="margin-left: 30px">It is called dirty
		blood because it has collected over nine months in the body. It is
		dark, smelly and clotted. It comes out first and then fresh clean
		blood comes out. With a little pressure and massage we take it out
		completely, and when the color of the blood becomes clear like monthly
		cycle we believe that it is clean.&quot; (Punjab)</p>
	<p class="default" style="margin-left: 30px">
		&quot;<em>Gola</em> is baby's home. When the house becomes empty, only
		dirty blood is left. When this comes out there is pain. Hot drinks (of
		<em>ajwain</em>,<em> saunth</em>, <em>pipar</em> and<em> gur</em>) are
		given. This drink cleans the belly. After the baby is born, the <em>gola</em>
		roams around. This <em>gola </em>has taken care of the baby, now it
		must leave. If the pain is intense then warm fomentation is done and <em>gola
		</em>melts away (pighal jata hai). This is dirty blood and needs cleaning
		up.&quot; (Delhi)
	</p>
	<p class="default">Perhaps in the dominant world religions
		(Judeo-Christian-Islamic and Hinduism, or more correctly Brahminism)
		the concept of narak or &#8216;hell&rsquo; overlays previous meaning
		systems which had more to do with the health of women than the purity
		of priests.</p>

		<span class="lrgtxt2">Re-entering the social world and saying
			goodbye to Bemata</span>
	</p>
	<p class="default">Women are ritually progressed from their status
		as &#8216;unclean&rsquo; differently, at different times, within
		different religious traditions. Interestingly both the Leviticus text
		in the Old Testament of the Bible and the Dharamshastra
		writings &ndash; both of which concern themselves with ritual
		cleanliness in their respective traditions &ndash; specify a longer
		period of &#8216;pollution&rsquo; for woman who has given birth to a
		female infant than a male infant! In the Indian context birth is
		celebrated and women&rsquo;s &#8216;confinement&rsquo; gradually comes
		to an end.</p>
	<p class="default" style="margin-left: 30px">
		On the 13th day after birth, the new mother is allowed to enter the
		kitchen. (<em>Chauka Charhana</em>). Some do it on 7th or on 11th day.
		Everybody celebrates. There is singing and dancing. On this day the
		new mother and the baby bathe and wear new clean clothes. She comes
		out to get everyone's blessing. Friends and relatives are invited and
		eat food together. The <em>Dai</em> is given clothes, food and grain.
		(Punjab)
	</p>
	<p class="default" style="margin-left: 30px">
		On the day of the birth ritual celebration (<em>Chhatti</em>-6th day)
		the woman wears everything that was taken off at the time of the
		birth. She put on bindi, bangles, <em>henna</em> and nose ring. We
		make ritual drawings of<em> swastik</em>, worship <em>Bemata</em> and
		light a lamp. We make a foot impression of the mother on the floor and
		then the woman enters the main house. Till the 5th day <em>Bemata
		</em>roams around in the house. After the birth celebrations <em>Bemata</em>
		leaves, she goes to another house. The <em>dai</em> also goes to serve
		others. (Rajasthan)

	</p>
	<p class="default">
		To my knowledge there are no shrines, formal images, textual
		references to <em>Bemata</em>. She is definitely a fleeting presence,
		invoked by women at the time of birth and sent off to another&rsquo;s
		home with postpartum ritual. According to the <em>dais</em> with whom
		we interacted, <em>Bemata</em> dwells in the realm of narak, deep
		within the earth. She is a Creatrix responsible for the conception,
		growth within the womb, and birth of human beings as well as the
		growth of all vegetation. In this image <em>Bemata</em> was drawn on a
		charpoy leg along with the <em>swastik</em>, a common post-birth
		ritual drawing.

	<p class="lrgtxt2">
		Contemporary relevance of <em>Bemata </em>and <em>Narak </em>
	</p>
	<p class="default">Shakina, a Muslim dai working in a slum of Delhi
		talked about birth time in a swirl of Hindu and Muslim
		references &ndash; a testimony to the syncretism of North Indian folk
		culture. And we found that Sikh, Christian, Muslim as well as
		&#8216;Hindu&rsquo; dais used the concepts and often the language of
		narak and Bemata. Look, sister, at the time of</p>
	<p class="default" style="margin-left: 30px">birth it&rsquo;s only
		the woman&rsquo;s shakti. She who gives birth, at that time, her one
		foot is in heaven and the other, in hell (narak). &rdquo;</p>
	<p class="default">Shakina goes on to say</p>
	<p class="default" style="margin-left: 30px">
		Before doing a delivery I get the woman to open all the trunks, doors
		and so on. I pray to the One above to open the knot quickly. I take
		off her sari, open her hair and take off any bangles or jewellery. I
		put the<em> atta</em> on a <em>thali</em> and ask the woman to divide
		it into two equal parts. Also I get Rs.1.25 in the name of <em>Sayyid</em>
		kept separately. But mostly I remember <em>Bemata</em>. Repeated I
		pray to <em>Bemata</em> &ldquo;O mother! Please open the knot
		quickly. &rdquo;
	</p>
	<p class="default">the &#8216;sympathetic magic&rsquo; of opening
		rituals. The untying of knots, opening of locks, doors and windows,
		loosening hair and removing bangles are common rites performed during
		labour throughout North India. This facilitation can be interpreted as
		an opening in the external word which is then mimicked or mirrored in
		the inner world of the maternal body. The manipulation of the external
		environment in this way serves as a permission and encouragement for
		the &#8216;opening of the body&rsquo;. The separation of the atta from
		one mound into two also imitates imaginatively the separation of the
		pregnant maternal body into two &ndash; mother and babe. When I first
		encountered these birth facilitations I noticed the parallel in guided
		imagery used in cancer treatments, when the patient was encouraged to
		imagine the T-cells and the immune system dealing with tumours. If
		internal imagery were effective, why should not externally manifest
		imagery also work?</p>
	<p class="default">
		<em>Narak</em> allows for a holistic and non-invasive diagnostics and
		therapeutics &ndash; health promoting practices which do not violate the
		integrity of the body and facilitate the &ldquo;<em>jee</em> &rdquo; or
		life force. This concept then provides a mode of understanding
		allowing practitioners and therapeutics which can negotiate and affect
		the inner body without violating the integrity of the skin/body/life
		force. And indeed the dais&rsquo; health modalities are sophisticated
		in terms of emotional support and ritual practice. As well as
		practical utilizing touch (massage, pressure, manipulation, assisted
		squat, external version); natural resources (mud, baths and
		fomentation, herbs, <em>gobar</em> or cow dung); and application of
		&#8216;hot and cold&rsquo; (in food and drink, fomentation, heating
		placenta to revive baby, birthing body as &#8216;heated&rsquo; etc.);
		isolation and protection (from household work and maternal, familial
		and sexual obligations).
	</p>
	<p class="default">
		This interpretation of narak is congruent with some dais usage of the
		terms &#8216;opening body&rsquo; (labour), &#8216;open body&rsquo;
		(birth), and &#8216;closing body&rsquo; (postpartum) &ndash; for the
		entire process of birth time. These empirical terms stand in
		opposition to the factory model of birth (labour, delivery, failure to
		progress, false labour) implicit in many obstetrical terms. And
		interestingly the womb-bond between mother and newborn continues to be
		respected during this time &ndash; <em>Narak ka Samay</em>.
	</p>
	<p class="lrgtxt2">Implications for improving midwifery/dai
		training</p>
	<p class="default">MATRIKA findings about &#8216;Narak&rsquo; have
		great relevance to public health initiatives targeted at dais. As
		MATRIKA data has demonstrated above, dais say</p>
	<p class="default" style="margin-left: 30px">&ldquo;Bad blood must
		come out. &rdquo;</p>
	<p class="default">Dai Trainers say</p>
	<p class="default" style="margin-left: 30px">&ldquo;Hemorrhage must
		stop. &rdquo;</p>
	<p class="default">
		In the context of postpartum care narak relates to the &#8216;bad
		blood&rsquo; that dais think must exit the body. That energy of the
		maternal body associated with growing the baby is signified by the
		&#8216;black blood&rsquo; &ndash; this fluid emerges signifying, not
		only the uterus contracting, but also that the mother&rsquo;s body is
		transiting from holding the &#8216;other&rsquo; to releasing the
		other. Sometimes we heard that the &#8216;contractions&rsquo; were the
		womb &#8216;searching&rsquo; for the baby. <em>Dai's</em> imaging
		speaks a poetics of the body that attributes consciousness, activity
		and sensation to the uterus-- which is totally absent in the
		biomedical framework. The understanding and use of these concepts in
		dai training would significantly improve communications on controlling
		hemorrhage postpartum, as well as preserve the respect for indigenous
		meaning systems.
	</p>
	<p class="default">
		Furthermore, the <em>Bemata</em> figure encodes a process orientation
		towards birth and postpartum while providing a framework for
		diagnostics and therapeutics. In obstetrical practice the examination
		done immediately after birth, &#8216;the Apgar score&rsquo;, is used
		to assess the well being of the newborn. It is a scale for measuring
		the infant&rsquo;s process of adapting to extra-uterine life. But no
		such formal, process-oriented assessment is geared towards the bodily
		functioning of the mother postpartum, the time the <em>dais </em>call
		&#8216;the closing of the body&rsquo;. <em>Bemata</em> seems to
		function as a diagnostic system assisting <em>dais</em> in their roles
		as caretakers of mothers, especially crucial in the six day post birth
		period.
	</p>
	<p class="default">
		The practice of not cutting the cord until the placenta is delivered
		is common in all the areas where MATRIKA conducted research. Doctors
		and health workers throughout the country also report it as the common
		practice. <em>Dais</em> have the utmost respect for these parts of the
		female body usually considered as waste products (by the bio-medical
		system) or highly polluting (by the Dharamshastras). It seems as
		though dais consider the infant-cord-placenta as a package. They have
		been together for nine months, cord and placenta functioning to
		nurture the fetus &ndash; why should they be severed too quickly?
	</p>
	<p class="default">
		Dais say<br /> &ldquo;Cut the cord after placenta is delivered &rdquo;
	</p>
	<p class="default" style="margin-left: 30px">If the baby is not
		active or does not cry then the dai rubs the cord, placing a coin or
		rice grain underneath it. By rubbing, heat passes to the baby. The
		baby often revives. Heating the placenta on a fire may also do this
		resuscitation. (Bihar)</p>
	<p class="default" style="margin-left: 30px">After birth, if the
		baby does not cry or is hardly breathing, or even seems stillborn, the
		placenta is used by placing it on a heated surface -- pan or cow dung
		cakes. Life flows towards the baby most of the time. It is only after
		she knows that this is not needed that the cord is cut. (Delhi)</p>

		body based on fact rather than superstitions. Our MATRIKA data,
		gathered by crossing boundaries and listening carefully, and
		respectfully, suggests that dais&rsquo; knowledge and practice are
		encoded in a language, a poetics of the body &ndash; which radically
		differs from that of bio-medical obstetrics, and is more congruent
		with other Asian medical/health/healing systems such as Yoga,
		Ayurveda, Tantra as well as Chinese, Tibetan and even Greek/Islamic
		medicine.</p>
	<p class="default">
		In order to facilitate communications in training indigenous midwives,
		as well as reclaim aspects of indigenous Indian midwifery for use with
		more privileged women <br /> MATRIKA recommends the development of
		criteria for evaluation of dais and their practices drawing on
		Ayurveda and other indigenous systems of health maintenance and
		healing. Rather than using the evaluation perspective of biomedicine,
		indigenous tools of assessment will allow the incorporation of a human
		resource base which can complement existing &#8216;reproductive
		health&rsquo; facilities and practitioners.
	</p>
	<p class="default">An entire legacy of midwifery knowledge will be
		erased unless we begin to learn to think and speak the language of
		&#8216;narak&rsquo; (and develop dai-training materials dialoguing
		with that language). Or at the very least we should not cringe in
		disdain when we hear or observe women using these languages, or
		observing these practices. Finally, on the Asian subcontinent it is
		essential that we begin to include skilled dais in maternal child
		health programs at all levels. Hopefully we will all be able to cross
		boundaries, listen carefully and help the world to be born more
		humanely.</p>
