<h2>Menstruation Meanings: Blood, Time and Magic</h2>

<span class="caption">
	This paper was written at the request of
	the Dharam Hinduja Center for Indic Studies by Janet Chawla
</span>

<p>
	At a Dharam Hinduja Center for Indic Studies organized gathering in
	Bangalore some years ago I met an old colleague and friend, an NGO
	activist working in the Northeast of India with women and women&rsquo;s
	health. We conversed outside of the formal sessions about my work on
	indigenous &lsquo;reproductive health&rsquo; (specifically menstruation
	and childbirth) and her activist and training work. She told me that at
	a recent training program conducted for her NGO by an activist-physician
	from Uttar Pradesh, he had stated that the practice of allowing
	menstrual blood to flow down one&rsquo;s legs, under their skirt-like
	wraps (which was observed by some of the traditionally oriented tribal
	women) was unhygienic and a possible source of infection and should be
	stopped. She asked me what I thought of the practice and the
	physician&rsquo;s intervention.
</p>

<p>
	I responded by saying that although we, with our sense of personal
	hygiene and decorum, might find this manner of handling menstruation
	distasteful, it probably would be far less likely to cause infection
	than an unclean menstrual cloth and I felt his advice reflected his own
	discomfort with the thought of menstrual blood flowing freely down
	female legs rather than any actual knowledge of vectors of infection.
</p>

<p>
	At an NGO health workers meeting in Gujarat, I was an observer to an
	interaction between the local dais/health workers and the head of the
	health program as well as an outside resource person--a doctor and
	health activist of long standing. The meeting was called in order to
	monitor the progress of an effort to build the skills of the dais to
	help women chart their menstrual cycles--and enable them to practice
	&lsquo;natural family planning&rsquo;. Becoming aware of the time of
	ovulation would help them practice birth control without invasive
	methods--was the idea. The non-literate dais had been provided
	calendar-charts to fill in with signs, one for each woman&rsquo;s
	menstrual cycle.
</p>

<p>
	However, much to my amazement, they used the solar, rather than the
	lunar calendar format. There was total confusion (which may have existed
	anyway) but the whole process would have been more effective had a lunar
	calendar been used for reckoning, as it is closer to the 28 day
	menstrual cycle, and the ritual festivals observed in the area follow
	lunar, rather than solar months. When I enquired as to how the NGO
	leaders decided to use the solar calendar, they said that they left the
	decision to the dais and village women and they voted to use the
	solar--the one that they knew the NGO followed!
</p>

<p>
	More recently I attended a national women&rsquo;s health meeting in
	Delhi. During one presentation made by a women&rsquo;s health NGO on
	their work with adolescents, the speaker said that they had taught young
	women to hang their menstrual cloths out to dry in the sun after washing
	them. She self-righteously stated that one mother even beat her daughter
	for putting her cloth outside (in view of others). The subtext of the
	presentation being &ldquo;These backwards and violent mothers &ndash; we
	must save poor adolescents from them! During the discussion period I
	raised my hand and voiced my concern that NGOs should not intervene in
	personal bodily practices in a manner which would lead a mother to react
	so vehemently to her daughter&rsquo;s behavior and I questioned whether
	the activists had investigated the mother&rsquo;s reasoning and cultural
	assumptions. I received no answer but afterwards, in private, other
	participants expressed their appreciation of my speaking out.
</p>

<p>
	At issue here is the dominance of modernist biomedicine in the policies
	and programs of health policymakers (be they global--WHO, Unicef, UNFPA
	etc, national and even local feminist and NGO groups. Their
	&lsquo;delivery of services&rsquo; and &lsquo;training&rsquo; approaches
	to health generally, and women&rsquo;s &lsquo;reproductive
	health&rsquo;, specifically, operate in complete ignorance of the
	epistemological and ontological foundations of indigenous body culture
	and health traditions. In South Asia one might even say
	&lsquo;civilizational&rsquo; body knowledge and practice.
</p>

<p>
	I have paid attention to indigenous Indian understandings, imaging and
	practical handling of menstruation and birth and the visions of the
	world and cosmos upon which they are based for many years. While
	studying theology with the Jesuits at
	<em>Vidyajyoti</em> Institute of Religious Studies in Delhi, I wrote a
	paper, &ldquo;The Mythic Origins of the Menstrual Taboo in the Rig
	Veda, &rdquo; (later published both in
	<em>Manushi</em> and in <em>Economic and Political Weekly</em> , Vol.
	XXIX, No 43, 22 October 1994) The paper used feminist protests against
	the use of Depo-Provera and other injections and implants of hormonal
	contraceptives as a starting point &ndash; because these drugs
	interfere drastically with the rhythm and nature of a woman&rsquo;s
	menstrual cycle. I investigated the narrative of Indra slaying Vritra
	as an explanatory mechanism for indigenous meanings and directives
	regarding menstrual blood and menstrual time. And I have continued to
	pursue these topics intellectually as well as practically with NGOs and
	what I call health and development wallahs.
</p>

<p>
	Menstrual bleeding, although often signified in terms of
	&lsquo;pollution&rsquo;, &lsquo;traditionally&rsquo; marked the
	cyclicity of nature (Sanskrit
	<em>rta</em> ) and is simultaneous with seasonality and fertility. The
	fertile capacity of women is conflated with that of the earth (and of
	the Devi, although that is not my concern here) and in women&rsquo;s
	ritual enactments this cyclicity is often honored and I would argue
	even sacralized. Priestly notions of pollution fade into the background
	when one listens to the dais and their notions of &lsquo;
	<em>narak</em> &rsquo; &#8211; which I will develop below -- and the
	&lsquo;sin&rsquo; of cutting the umbilical cord. In a MATRIKA produced
	documentary film &ldquo;Born at Home &rdquo; the filmmaker interviews
	an elderly Rajasthani dai, Rukma Dadi, who laughs as she relates that
	some say it is a &lsquo;great paap&rsquo; to cut the cord. She
	confidently dismisses society-at-large in their categories of sin and
	pollution and purity (so ardently amplified in early Indological
	writings). This confidence was shared by the elderly dais with whom we
	interacted during our MATRIKA project. Dai work is &lsquo;
	<em>seva ka kam</em> &rsquo; or, as one Punjabi
	<em>dai</em> stated &ldquo; <em>Raab</em> (God) is the doer, the hands
	are mine. &rdquo; We attempted, through this field level research to
	document and conceptually interpret their imaging of body and world.
</p>

<p>
	My purpose here, however, is not to untangle Indological
	misrepresentations and modernist &lsquo;maldevelopment&rsquo;, but
	rather to relate some of my own intellectual journey as wife, mother,
	bahu and now grandmother within a Sikh family in Delhi; teaching
	childbirth preparation classes to a middle and upper class clientele;
	studying theology with the Jesuits focusing on Leviticus, the
	Dharamshatra, Rig Veda, caste and gender and birth traditions; and, my
	favorite, interacting with dais on their lives and understandings of the
	female body. I have moved through Indian, US, British and South Asian
	academic, public health, feminist and activist circles. This game of
	musical chairs is sometimes called networking.
</p>

<h3>MATRIKA Research</h3>

<p>
	MATRIKA, (Motherhood and Traditional Resources, Information, Knowledge
	and Action), which I initiated, was a three year research effort to
	document, interpret and analyze traditional midwives&rsquo;
	ethno-medical and religio-cultural traditions. The MATRIKA team learned
	from dais in workshops held collaboratively with NGOs in Bikaner
	District of Rajasthan; Gomia, Bihar; Fategarh District in Punjab and the
	resettlement colonies of Delhi. We inverted the common dai-training
	model and asked them to train us. After they became convinced of our
	sincerity we collectively explored their knowledge and practice through
	discussions and interviews, role plays of birth and rituals, as well as
	ritual drawings, body mappings and sohars or birth songs.
</p>

<p>
	Our reclamation effort, however, required putting aside the assumption,
	often shared by both researcher and religious elite, that spiritual
	power entails ritual purity. The midwife has not been seen in the Indian
	context as a ritual specialist and a resource for sacred knowledge, or
	in anyway related to &ldquo;spiritual &rdquo; activity, because of their
	caste status and the fact that female bodily processes were deemed
	antithetical to spiritual power and practice. Probing, not to mention
	theorizing the &lsquo;subaltern&rsquo; is not an easy task. Modern
	institutions and academic disciplines since colonial times have
	marginalized dais, in part, because they have not been able to
	comprehend them. As poor, illiterate and mostly low and outcaste women,
	their health knowledge and practice has been denigrated and
	invisiblised. Our MATRIKA approach allowed the categories of religion
	and medicine to intertwine &ndash; and we adapted our research
	methodologies to grapple with these indigenous, holistic childbirth and
	healing modalities. We also resisted the dominant modern perspective
	that labels dais&rsquo; ways of knowing and practices as ignorance and
	&lsquo;superstition&rsquo;.
</p>

<h3>Narak and the &lsquo;Dirty&rsquo; Female Body</h3>

<p>
	For many years I have been puzzled by the seeming contradictions I have
	encountered when researching traditionally oriented women&rsquo;s birth
	knowledge and practice. On the one hand they use expressions such as nau
	mahena ka narak kund (nine months&rsquo; hell spring or pond) for the
	afterbirth (placenta, cord and membranes) and observe what we call
	&lsquo;pollution taboos&rsquo; (not doing puja, going to the mandir or
	reading holy books) during menstruation or postpartum. In the Indian
	context it is important to note that women of all the dominant religions
	on the subcontinent have observed ritual pollution. Muslim, Sikh,
	Christian and Buddhist women have practiced their own forms of pollution
	which involve ritual distance from religious practice. (Of course
	similar ritual separation between women&rsquo;s reproductive capacity,
	considered ritual &lsquo;impurity&rsquo;, and religious practice is also
	to be found in the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition. The Book of
	Leviticus, in the Old Testament is strikingly similar to the
	Dharamshastra injunctions which regulate the behavior of women during
	menstruation and postpartum.)
</p>

<p>
	On the other hand the same women report empowering birth rituals both
	during labor and the post-birth period. Differing perspectives on the
	significance of narak reveal the gendered power relations which have
	existed on the Indian subcontinent for millennia.
</p>

<p>
	I have come to the conclusion that when women and men participate in
	common rituals, as in all of the dominant religions, the special female
	experiences of the body, become inserted in a male-centered, often
	abstract, conceptual or &lsquo;mystical&rsquo; ritual or praxis
	domain &ndash; leaving behind uniquely female bodily experiences and the
	religio-cultural customs which celebrate it. The internal logic of
	dais&rsquo; ethno-medical and religio-cultural practice proceeds from
	ways of perceiving and knowing which can be legitimately termed
	religious or even &lsquo;theological&rsquo;. They follow a chain of
	reasoning and use causal linkages embedded in divine and demonic
	figures. Furthermore dais&rsquo; epistomology and ontology are entirely
	congruent with other indigenous systems such as Tantra, Yoga and
	Ayurveda. A gender-sensitive perspective requires questioning why
	sophisticated and holistic body-spirit knowledge and practice are
	acknowledged within these systems-- but when it comes to knowledge and
	&lsquo;spirituality&rsquo; related to the female body, dais are
	perceived as ignorant and superstitious. Narak, a concept from our
	MATRIKA data which I have developed and amplified, functions as an entry
	point and fundamental organizing principle for the world view of dais.
</p>

<h3>
	&lsquo;<em>Narak</em>&rsquo; as the Unseen and Fertile Inner World of
	the Earth and of the Female Body
</h3>

<p>
	<em>Bemata </em> dwells in the realm of <em>narak</em> , deep within
	the earth. She is a Creatrix causing the conception, growth within the
	womb, and birth of human beings as well as the growth of all
	vegetation. During our first workshop in Gomia, Bihar dais explained
	the meaning of
	<em>narak</em> to us in terms of menstruation and postpartum:
</p>

<blockquote>
	Girls are considered holy before puberty. The marriage of a young girl
	who has not had her periods is performed with her sitting on her
	father&rsquo;s lap. After puberty the woman is considered unclean, and
	is unholy, because she bleeds, and this is narak. <br /> <br /> On
	Chhati day (after birth) the narak time ends. The Dai checks if the
	umbilical cord has fallen off. Then she bathes the baby and beats a
	thaali and gives the baby to Chachi. Then the woman is bathed and wears
	new clothes. The Dai then cleans the room where the birth took place
	and the mother was kept separately for six days.
</blockquote>

<p>
	Although often translated as hell or demonic place, narak can be
	understood as the site or energy of the unseen inner world - of the
	earth and of the body. Narak has the connotation &lsquo;filth&rsquo; but
	also signifies the fertility or fruitful potential of the earth and
	woman&rsquo;s body. Pollution &lsquo;taboos&rsquo; are related to narak,
	as the idea of the sacred is radically separated from the reproductive
	potential of the female body. During menstruation and post birth women
	are considered &lsquo;unclean&rsquo;. However the dai speaks with a very
	different voice than the pundit and the Puranas about narak. To her the
	placenta, the ultimate polluting substance to the &ldquo;twice
	born &rdquo;, is spoken of reverently, as &lsquo;another mother&rsquo;.
	It is no coincidence that dais are mainly from low and outcaste
	communities. Both caste and gender are implicated in concepts of narak.
	Ayurvedic and naturopathic practitioners often employ low caste people
	to apply the hands-on therapies they prescribe. And interestingly in our
	MATRIKA team&rsquo;s analysis of birth time (which in obstetrical
	terminology is referred to as &lsquo;labor&rsquo;, &lsquo;birth&rsquo;
	and &lsquo;postpartum&rsquo;) we adopted the dais&rsquo; language of
	&lsquo;the opening body&rsquo;, &lsquo;the open body&rsquo;, and
	&lsquo;the closing body&rsquo;. Narak can be viewed as representing
	&lsquo;the open body&rsquo;. This is the time when what is normally
	closed, is open, the liminal and dangerous time/space of generative,
	female bodily processes. Interestingly, within the dais&rsquo; rubric
	the danger that they are concerned about is to the mother--her openness
	implying her vulnerability.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Narak</em> functions as a basic ethno-medical idea, providing a
	conceptual framework for a host of non-invasive therapeutic
	interventions. Narak speaks of the inner world of the body,
	particularly to the mysterious creative power of the female body (and
	simultaneously the earth body) invisible to the human eye. This concept
	provides a mode of understanding which facilitates non-invasive
	diagnostics and therapeutics. Dais practice many gentle, non-invasive
	techniques which affect physiological functioning without violating the
	integrity of the skin/body/life force. Their &lsquo;holistic&rsquo;
	health modalities utilize touch (massage, pressure, manipulation);
	natural resources (mud, baths and fomentation, herbs); application of
	&lsquo;hot and cold&rsquo; (in food and drink, fomentation etc.); and
	isolation and protection (from domestic, maternal and sexual
	obligations).
</p>

<p>
	In my networking in North India, as well as our MATRIKA research areas,
	I have found that &lsquo;traditionally&rsquo;
	<em>dais</em> serve and move between the homes of different religious
	communities--and so do concepts such as
	<em>narak</em> . Caste operates as a category, but religion
	doesn&rsquo;t. It seems as if dais and women&rsquo;s birth traditions
	have flown beneath the radar screens of the dominant religious
	orthodoxies that haven&rsquo;t bothered to police this dirty
	women&rsquo;s business.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Shakina</em> Dai, a Muslim midwife, mentions offerings to
	<em>Sayyid</em> , an Islamic figure, but similarly invokes Bemata. She
	also refers to the laboring woman as having one foot in heaven and the
	other in
	<em>narak</em> or hell.
</p>

<blockquote>
	Look, sister, at the time of birth it&rsquo;s only the woman&rsquo;s <em>Shakti</em>.
	She who gives birth, at that time, her one foot is in heaven and the
	other, in hell. Before doing a delivery I get the woman to open all the
	trunks, doors and so on. I pray to the One Above to open the knot
	quickly. I take off the sari, open the hair and take off the bangles or
	any jewelry. I put<em> atta</em> on a <em>thali</em> and ask the woman
	to divide it into two equal parts. Also I get Rs.1.25 in the name of <em>Sayyid</em>
	kept separately. But mostly I remember Bemata. Repeatedly I pray to <em>Bemata</em>
	&ldquo;Oh mother! please open the knot quickly. &rdquo;
</blockquote>

<p>
	<em>Dais</em> from all religions have invoked Bemata. In workshops in
	the Punjab, Mazbi (outcaste)
	<em>Sikh dais</em> , after first claiming they had no rituals, said
	that they, too, pray to
	<em>Bemata</em> .
</p>

<h3>Networking Knowledge - Advocating for Indic Systems of Medicine</h3>

<p>
	I have been enabled to follow my own woman-centered curiosity and move
	through varied domains and disciplines, beholden to no institution or
	way of thinking, in good part by networking. Particularly valuable to me
	personally, and society at large (especially as caesarean section rates
	skyrocket and the female body is increasingly perceived as incapable of
	menstruation, birth and menopause without pharmaceutical or surgical
	assistance) is the nexus between midwives, who actually handle the
	female body and the stuff of birth, and scholars or academia.
</p>

<p>
	As I write this essay at my mother&rsquo;s home in Port Townsend,
	Washington, I have just traveled to Vancouver, BC to show our MATRIKA
	film &lsquo;Born at Home&rsquo; to a group of &lsquo;guerilla&rsquo;
	midwives--this has been organized by a midwife-scholar, Nane Jordan,
	whom I had never met. Nane learned of my work in a Women&rsquo;s
	Spirituality Masters Program in San Francisco! Through email and mutual
	friends we came together to watch a film on dais--whom the health
	establishment refuses to dignify with the term
	&ldquo;midwives &rdquo;--they are Traditional Birth Attendants or
	&lsquo;TBAs&rsquo;--to be trained, not the inheritors of India&rsquo;s
	midwifery traditions. And the women who eagerly watched the film are
	&lsquo;guerilla midwives&rsquo; for much the same reason. Since the
	regulation of midwifery under the British Columbia College of Midwives
	in 1998, any woman who &lsquo;attends&rsquo; a woman&rsquo;s birth is
	doing so illegally--and they also are not allowed to call themselves
	midwives! &ldquo;This is freedom? This is gender equality? This is
	women&rsquo;s empowerment? &rdquo; I ask myself as I learn that
	Nane&rsquo;s chosen midwife, who attended her previous home birth and is
	known and respected in their Vancouver birth community, was jailed for 5
	months for attending births and leading a birth workshop.
</p>

<p>
	This issue of regulation, legitimization is not new to me. When I was a
	scholar-in-residence at the Five College Women&rsquo;s Studies Research
	Center, in Western Massachusetts I heard an American nurse-midwife speak
	of a bill that they had introduced to the state legislature which would
	take the certification for midwives out of the hands of the Nursing
	Board and creating a Midwifery Board. My sensitivity to the outsider
	status of dais in India alerted me to the fact that some group of
	midwives would be negatively affected by this move. When I asked the
	midwife about who would be further marginalized by the proposed
	legislation, she immediately said that it would be three categories of
	women attending births: Native Americans (who have their own traditions
	regarding birth); street midwives (who catch the babies of drug addicts,
	commercial sex workers and homeless women) and Amish women (who have a
	spiritual practice within which birth is not defined within a state,
	professional or technological frame). Each of the above group would be
	further marginalized, denied any possibility of medical backup and even
	liable to prosecution for helping women birth.
</p>

<p>
	The intention of midwifery, as the word&rsquo;s origin implies, is
	&lsquo;with women&rsquo; and not hierarchically or externally placed.
	These Canadian &ldquo;guerilla midwives &rdquo; are not a homogenous
	group, nor are they silly and irresponsible women, as the media and the
	medical profession might have us believe. One young recent graduate of
	nursing school was chatting with me after the film and said that she had
	just turned down a job offer at the hospital where she had studied. She
	found the hospital procedures so degrading for herself, as midwife and
	the mother and family and she would not have been allowed to practice
	her &lsquo;calling&rsquo; and vision of what a midwife could be.
</p>

<p>
	Last summer I presented a power point presentation on
	<em>Narak</em> at a conference &ldquo;Pollution and Safety: the Dirty
	Side of Women&rsquo;s Health &rdquo; organized by a dynamic scholar
	midwife who heads the Department of Nursing and Midwifery at Sheffield
	University. I was suggested as a presenter by another scholar- midwife
	whom I&rsquo;d met at an International Confederation of Midwives
	conference in Delhi 10 years ago. At the time of the conference I was
	editing a book on birth commissioned by an Indian publisher and editor
	of their &ldquo;Shakti &rdquo; imprint and I was searching for a paper
	attempting to place an economic value on dais&rsquo; health work
	contribution.
	<em>Birth and Birthgivers</em> : the <em> Power behind the
		Shame</em> , which is now in press, is an assembly of pieces on birth
	from varied positions and perspectives. It now includes an essay by
	Subhadra Rai, another conference presenter, which she had presented in
	Japan, &ldquo;Towards Calculating the Monetary Contributions of
	Dais&rsquo; Work. &rdquo;
</p>

<p>
	Without these networks which have shown interest in my work and the
	young women interns, volunteers, researchers, MATRIKA team members, who
	are terribly excited by non-biomedical understandings of femaleness--I
	would not have the confidence to continue to theorize, flesh out and
	advocate for what I have learned from dais.
</p>

<p>
	This essay has presented to me clearly that what I do is indeed called
	networking. It is not the usual business-sense or even academic-sense of
	networking where one moves among colleagues to exchange information
	within a certain domain. In a way I network amongst networks--health and
	religion, anthropology and art, scholar and activist, feminist and NGO.
</p>

<p>
	It seems to me the task at hand involves a more active role for
	academicians and scholars in interfacing with public health problems
	such as safe motherhood. For too long scholars have been preoccupied
	with the local; they have not produced coherent and simple descriptions
	of the broad sweep of Indian or subcontinental body knowledge and
	culture. In order to effectively advocate for inclusion of indigenous
	practitioners such as dais, data is needed on commonalities across
	regions. Certainly herbs may be different in different areas--but
	concepts underlying their efficacy (&lsquo;heating&rsquo; or stimulating
	metabolic action during labor) will be similar. Dais practices will
	certainly be couched in different regional languages--literally and
	metaphorically--but traditionally, from Punjab to Kanya Kumari, no dai
	would cut the umbilical cord before the placenta emerged. And all dais
	would stimulate the placenta by heating it--in order for the
	&ldquo;jee &rdquo; or life force to pass into the newborn, should he/she
	require resuscitation.
</p>

<p>
	In India national health policy has been, and continues to be
	significantly determined by &lsquo;globalization&rsquo;. First, by
	colonial hegemonic valorization of western medicine and science. Now, by
	World Health Organization, Unicef and the like. Under this influence the
	stated Government of India policy of institutionalization for all births
	is absolute folly and continues to deskill the midwives (and other women
	who attend by far the majority of births) and create dependency on
	nonexistent or abysmal quality services. Today even Ayurvedic Colleges
	teach more allopathy than Ayurveda! And government programs in the
	Department of Health and Family Welfare devoted to ISM or Indigenous
	Systems of Medicine focus on the promotion of growth of herbal medicine,
	rather than the development of the human resources who
	&lsquo;traditionally&rsquo; practice this kind of medicine. Surely the
	project of Indic Traditions of Healthcare remains unfinished.
</p>
