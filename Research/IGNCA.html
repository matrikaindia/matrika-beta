<h3>Part I &ndash; the context</h3>

<p>
    Interest in indigenous knowledge is increasing as the general public,
    and even policy makers observe the onslaught of problems associated with
    modern life. Traditional medicine is explored for use in the treatment
    of HIV/AIDS; indigenous knowledge is utilized in the service of
    agriculture and biodiversity conservation; strategies for the validation
    and protection of indigenous knowledge systems are being developed. It
    is finally being acknowledged that we have left behind valuable
    resources along this road to progress and &lsquo;development&rsquo;.
    This paper explores and reclaims indigenous childbirth knowledge,
    generally, and on the Indian subcontinent specifically. First I will
    briefly (and critically) address the current scenario of how the world
    is being born &ndash; and the problems associated with what has come to be
    called &lsquo;the medicalization&rsquo; of childbirth.
</p>

<p>
    Within this scenario women give birth very differently according to
    their class status. The mass medicalization of birth effectively
    constructs this female physiological process as a medical, rather than a
    womanly and human phenomenon. Medicalization has negatively impacted
    poor and well off in different ways &ndash; as well as displacing
    indigenous practitioners, skills and knowledge systems.
</p>

<p>
    Data from one Indian study on caesarean rates showed that interventions
    during labour are correlated to families&rsquo; utilization of private
    sector institutions, indicating that the ability to pay actually
    compromises women&rsquo;s health, as will be shown below, there is no
    evidence that outcomes are better.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">There is reason to believe that current
	rates are part of a rising trend. This cannot be attributed only to the
	rise in institutional deliveries because of the strong association
	between caesarean sections and private sector institutions&#8230;. In
	Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh,
	the risk of undergoing caesarean section in private sector institutions
	is four or more times that of a public sector institution.
</p>

<p>
    From the heart of the global public health establishment, the World
    Health Organization, comes the observation that improvement in outcomes
    (the well being of mother and newborn) are not associated with high
    caesarean rates.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
	Continued increases in rates of obstetrical intervention are unlikely
	to lead to improvements in birth outcome and may result in a higher
	incidence of adverse outcome for mothers and their offspring. The risks
	associated with caesarean section include: damage to uterine blood
	vessels; accidental extension of the uterine incision; damage to the
	urinary bladder; anaesthesia accidents; wound infections; maternal
	mortality. Depressed Apgar score; higher rates of neonatal respiratory
	distress; shortened mean length gestation; and higher perinatal
	mortality in subsequent pregnancies are also indicated. (World Health
	Organization publication, 1992. <em>International Differences in
		the Use of Obstetrical Interventions</em>)
</p>

<p>
    Interestingly these statistics are not showcased in UN public health
    agencies&rsquo; data and publications currently. Perhaps because Safe
    Motherhood policies are formulated by biomedical doctors and the public
    health establishment who would rather be perceived as rescuers of women
    in distress, rather than practitioners over-utilizing obstetrical
    interventions!
</p>

<p>
    However, buried in medical and health policy journals critical
    evaluations do exist &ndash; such as this reference to a caesarean
    &lsquo;epidemic&rsquo; in developing countries. In
    &ldquo;Over-medicalisation of Maternal Care in Developing
    Countries &rdquo; the author concludes, &ldquo;the epidemic of C.
    sections continues in Latin America and extends into Asia. In addition
    there are signs of a worldwide epidemic of other interventions. There is
    an urgent need to build strong strategies to promote evidence-based
    interventions. &rdquo;
</p>

<p>
    Some health analysts advocate that medical institutions themselves
    should monitor caesarean rates performed by obstetricians practicing in
    their hospitals.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
	J. Quilligan, MD, an editor of the<em> American Journal of
		Obstetrics</em> and <em>Gynecology</em> wrote, &quot;Every hospital that
	has an obstetric service should have some committee that examines every
	cesarean section that is performed in that hospital and determines
	whether it was indicated or not. If it was not indicated, then the
	physician who performed the section should be educated as to why it was
	not indicated.&quot;
</p>
<p>
    Often the obstetricians performing surgeries are out of touch with
    women&rsquo;s suffering which is caused by surgical interventions.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">The lack of concern among many
	obstetricians about the after-effects of the rising caesarean rates may
	result from the fact that they spend little time post-natally with
	women who had had caesarean sections and are far removed from any
	physical or psychological ill-effects resulting from the operation.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, some research confirms that within a supportive
    environment, the judicious interfacing of traditional practitioners and
    quality referral units in case of emergency, birth at home can be not
    only affordable, but also relatively safe.
</p>
<p>
    The Comprehensive Rural Health Project in Jamkhed, Ahmednagar District
    of Maharashtra was the site of a study following 2861
    deliveries &ndash; 85% of these births were at home. Hospitalized patients
    with obstetric complications constituted only 11.4% of all deliveries.
    The caesarean section rate for all deliveries was only 2.0%. This is
    with poor and rural women &ndash; in urban hospitals it is not uncommon
    for caesarean rates to reach 50%!
</p>

<p>
    The authors point out the policy context that their findings radically
    question and make their own recommendations.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
	Some assume that in developing countries hospital service for the poor
	must be in government hospitals and that a large proportion of
	deliveries needs to be in these hospitals to provide timely access to
	emergency care. This presents a major problem in countries like India,
	where almost all rural deliveries are at home and accessible government
	hospitals generally do not provide surgical treatment for obstetric
	emergencies. <br /> <br /> A network of private clinics with a
	voluntary, low cost hospital providing effective EmOC in a remote rural
	area at very low per capita cost in the absence of easily accessible
	government service and with only 15% of deliveries in hospitals.
	Charges are low but low per capita cost is primarily due to intelligent
	self-selection of patients who need hospital care. Even though overall
	cost is low, cost is still an important barrier for many poor families.
	Improving the purchasing power of poor families through insurance or
	subsidy could be a more effective way to improve EmOC than trying to
	improve inadequate government facilities.per capita cost is primarily

</p>

<p>
    Although there were maternal deaths, there were only two (70 per 100,000
    live births whereas the National Family Health Survey estimates the
    national average as 450 per 100,000 live births) and these, according to
    the authors, could have been avoided by earlier referral to hospital.
</p>

<p>
    Socio-cultural phenomena are also implicated in high Caesarean rates
    among the moneyed classes. The induction of labour, often leading to
    c-sections if the cervix does not open, is sought by mothers-to-be or
    their families for various reasons: in order to bring the mother and
    baby home by Diwali; to time the birth to be auspicious, according to
    astrological reckoning; and one interesting study asserted that the 90%
    rate among middle-class Calcutta women was due to patient-selected
    surgery as a means to avoid postpartum work in the mother&rsquo;s
    sasural!
</p>

<h3>Part II &ndash; The Dais and Narak</h3>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
	Look, sister, at the time of birth it&rsquo;s only the woman&rsquo;s
	shakti. She who gives birth, at that time, her one foot is in heaven
	and the other, in hell (narak). The woman&rsquo;s shakti is indeed a
	lot when she gives birth to a child. Before doing a delivery I get the
	woman to open all the trunks, doors and so on. I pray to the One above
	to open the knot quickly. I take off the sari, open the hair and take
	off the bangles or any jewellery. I put atta on a thali and ask the
	woman to divide it into two equal parts. Also I get Rs.1.25 in the name
	of Sayyid kept separately. But mostly I remember Bemata. Repeated I
	pray to Bemata &ldquo;O mother! Please open the knot quickly. (Shakina
	Dai &#8211; A Muslim midwife from Delhi) <br /> <br /> Girls are
	considered holy before puberty. The marriage of a young girl, who has
	not had her periods, is performed with her sitting on her
	father&rsquo;s lap. After puberty the woman is considered unclean, and
	is unholy, because she bleeds, and this is Narak. (Bihar) <br /> <br />
	On Chhati day the Narak period ends. The Dai checks if the umbilical
	cord has fallen off. Then she bathes the baby and beats a thaali
	(plate). After this the woman is bathed and wears new clothes. The Dai
	cleans the room where the delivery took place and the woman was kept
	separately for six days. The dirty clothes of mother and child are
	washed. After this the Dai is given soap and oil for bathing. All this
	is on the sixth day after delivery. (Bihar)
</p>

<p>
    As a writer-researcher I have studied traditional Indian
    midwifery &ndash; dais and their knowledge of the female body, skills and
    customs &ndash; for many years. While taking the Shatabdi train to
    Chandigarh some years ago, I met the United States Agency for
    International Development public health professional in charge of
    &ldquo;reproductive health and nutrition &rdquo;. As we stood in the
    train chatting he asked if I were still active in research on dais. I
    said &lsquo;yes&rsquo;. He spoke the standard line &ldquo;If a birth is
    normal, then dais are fine, but if any complication arises, they are
    incapable of handling it. I spontaneously responded to his statement, by
    sharing what we were learning about the use of the placenta, stimulating
    it by heat, to resuscitate a listless newborn. The gentleman&rsquo;s
    eyes glazed over and he terminated the conversation with a polite
    &ldquo;I hope your research goes well. &rdquo; I got the impression that
    I could have quoted any set of health statistics, no matter how
    spurious, and we could have continued talking. But because I, as
    academics would say, &lsquo;shifted the terms of the discourse&rsquo;
    and mentioned the lowly placenta, and what I had learned from some dais,
    our communication could not proceed.
</p>
<p>
    Safe Motherhood discourse in India speaks the language of
    statistics &ndash; how many mothers die and of what complications. But
    that interface between the mother&rsquo;s body and the growing fetus,
    the placenta, and its indigenous medical use by
    <em>dais</em>
    , is outside the boundaries of professional public health discourse.
    Equally unmentionable is the vast legacy of indigenous, hands-on and
    low-tech, body knowledge of dais &ndash; because this healing and health
    modality has been totally rejected as viable knowledge by
    &lsquo;modern&rsquo; professionals. Yet if we, the powerful, moneyed and
    English-educated segment of the Indian populace (including doctors and
    public health professionals) are serious about reducing maternal and
    infant mortality and reaching any kind of &lsquo;health for all by the
    year&#8230;.&rsquo; we must reach out to indigenous practitioners like
    the
    <em>dais</em>
    and the traditionally oriented women whom they serve, and make efforts
    to understand their ethno-medical expertise and religio-cultural
    knowledge systems. &ldquo;Participation &rdquo;, a much bandied about
    term in NGO circles, is meaningless unless such mutually respectful
    exchanges take place.
</p>

<p>
    Too many health policy makers and bio-medical institutions are frozen in
    their approaches to maternal-child health, in part because they presume
    that western medicine is the only scientific and effective
    body-knowledge system &ndash; and that dais are ignorant and
    superstitious. These presuppositions inform so many well-intentioned
    health care initiatives. An advertisement for a health guide for
    grassroots women,
    <em>Where Women Have No Doctor</em>
    , illustrates this perspective:
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
	All over the world women rise to their daily work, care for their
	families and participate in community life. Too often, women must face
	these challenges while struggling against illness &ndash; <em>lacking
		even basic information about their health</em>. (Italics, mine)
</p>

<p>
    It is truly shocking that people who mean well are so ignorant of the
    knowledge and skill resources of &lsquo;the other&rsquo;. Thus an
    indigenous, culturally appropriate, affordable and sustainable body of
    knowledge is rendered invisible in the enterprise of
    &ldquo;development &rdquo; and delivery of health services.
</p>

<p>
    And this invisibility pervades the professional mind-set. Scientific
    method seems to have culminated in a process in which validation of
    efficacy necessitates double-blind, randomised control trials. This
    methodology may be suitable for pharmaceuticals, but not for indigenous,
    holistic therapeutics which heal or restore balance in the body via
    multi-factoral interventions. The dominance of this research paradigm
    challenges researchers to describe, interpret and value indigenous
    therapeutic methods. These health and body-knowledge modalities utilize
    Asia-specific body mappings and draw upon human capacities alien to
    bio-medical and public health approaches. Even qualitative research
    methodologies use biomedical assumptions as a starting point, enter the
    field armed with questionnaires and interview schedules, and neglect to
    contextualize their research in the grassroots realities of extreme
    poverty and radically different ontologies and epistemologies
</p>

<p>
    Furthermore &lsquo;gender&rsquo; becomes a whipping boy and health
    interventions fail to apprehend traditionally oriented women as
    subjects, knowers and decisionmakers within their own contexts.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">Linking modern with traditional
	understanding and practice can be a despairing task&#8230;. At times,
	we just cannot do it. This may be because we see something
	wrong--anti-woman--in a tradition being followed with devotion by many
	women. Or, we may feel we do not know enough or anything at all about a
	set of practices and the belief system behind them. (Dr. Mohan
	Deshpande, Curriculum Revision and Development, Women and Health
	Programme)
</p>

<p>
    It is essential that indigenous cultural resources be valued rather than
    denigrated as a stumbling block that detracts from the use of more
    appropriate biomedical treatment &ndash; especially in the case of
    childbirth, which is not a pathological state.
</p>

<h3>MATRIKA Methodology</h3>

<p>
    In 1997 we set out to research
    <em>dais</em>
    &rsquo; knowledge and practice &ndash; the indigenous heritage of
    women&rsquo;s body knowledge encoded in religio-cultural forms. The
    ethnographic data contained in this paper is drawn from three years of
    research by MATRIKA (Motherhood and Traditional Resources, Information,
    Knowledge and Action) &ndash; an NGO effort to document, interpret and
    analyze traditional midwives&rsquo; ethno-medical and religio-cultural
    traditions. The MATRIKA team learned of dais&rsquo; practices and
    cosmo-visions in three years of workshops in Rajasthan, Bihar, Punjab
    and slums on the outskirts of Delhi. Invaluable assistance was provided
    by local NGOs, particularly their health workers who were themselves
    from the communities and often had longstanding relationships with the
    dais. Health workers, who are not a part of the professional cadre, or
    part of the NGO establishment, often have a &lsquo;feel&rsquo; for the
    language and orientation of traditionally oriented women. When given
    permission from their superiors they can be an invaluable human resource
    in orienting organizations toward a respectful understanding of the
    &lsquo;client&rsquo; communities. Unfortunately, being keenly aware of
    the power and attitudes of their supervisors, they usually remain quiet.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
	MATRIKA&rsquo;s methodology has been to reverse the common TBA
	(Traditional Birth Attendant) training model by asking groups of <em>dais</em>
	to &lsquo;train us&rsquo; by answering the question &lsquo;what does a
	woman need during pregnancy, labour, birth and postpartum?&rsquo; Role
	plays, ritual drawings, singing of birth songs, sharing of birth
	experiences (ours and theirs) as well as <em>dais</em>&rsquo; life
	narratives were our workshop activities. We were able to access, and
	remain with, this alien (to us) information because we decided at the
	outset not to execute the common approach of limiting ourselves to the
	modern categories of &lsquo;medicine&rsquo; and &lsquo;health&rsquo;.
	Rather we chose to be receptive to diverse ways of facilitating birth,
	diagnosing and healing &ndash; to ritual enactments, notions of deities
	and demons, <em>bhut-pret </em>(ghosts and spirits) and the <em>nazar</em>
	or evil eye.
</p>

<p>
    We attempted to let the data speak the categories rather than have the
    categories shape the data. At first, of course, dais seemed to want to
    impress us with their knowledge of the modern, biomedical approach. But
    especially after our own enactments of the loneliness and confusion of a
    woman labouring in a hospital, they were convinced of our critical
    evaluation of modern birth and began to trust and share what they really
    believed and practiced. Ours was a collective effort: a group of
    researcher-activists interacting with a group of dais. We ate, slept,
    talked, sang and danced, produced drawings and plays together. Our
    workshop activities were a celebration of the fertile capacity of female
    body and of the dais&rsquo; cultural handling of childbirth. Our goal
    was to generate data which would enable informed, interactive dialogues
    between indigenous and biomedical practitioners.
</p>

<h3>Rethinking &ldquo;pollution &rdquo; and reformulation of narak</h3>

<p>
    Mediation between the ethnomedical and the biomedical, and retrieving
    valuable cultural resources, involves crossing boundaries and listening
    carefully &ndash; to the unspoken as well as spoken words. We learned that
    although the
    <em>dais</em>
    use some of the language of caste Hindu (and Sikh, Muslim and Christian)
    orthodoxy, denoting the defiling nature of birth, older
    <em> dais</em>
    often maintain a healthy distance and ironic
    <em>disdain</em>
    for the attitudes which demean their work. Inheritors of the
    <em>dai</em>
    tradition see themselves primarily as servants of the life force and
    can&rsquo;t be bothered with rebutting Brahmanic theological and caste
    formulations &ndash; they are occupied with delivering babies, caring for
    their families and agricultural and other work.
</p>

<p>
    Although often translated as hell or demonic place,
    <em>narak</em>
    can be understood as the site or energy of the unseen inner
    world &ndash; of the earth and of the body.
    <em>Narak</em>
    has the connotation &lsquo;filth&rsquo; but also signifies the fertility
    or fruitful potential of the earth and woman&rsquo;s body. So-called
    &lsquo;pollution taboos&rsquo; are related to
    <em>narak</em>
    , in that the idea of the sacred is radically separated from the
    reproductive potential of the female body. During menstruation and post
    partum women are considered &lsquo;unclean&rsquo;. However the dai
    speaks with a very different voice than the pundit about
    <em>narak</em>
    . To her the placenta, the ultimate polluting substance to caste Hindus
    or the &lsquo;twice born &rdquo;, is spoken of reverently, as
    &lsquo;another mother&rsquo;. It is no coincidence that dais are mainly
    from and outcaste communities. Both caste and gender are involved in
    concepts of narak. (Ayurvedic and naturopathic practitioners often
    employ low caste people to apply the hands-on therapies they prescribe).
    And interestingly in our MATRIKA team&rsquo;s analysis of birth time
    (which in obstetrical terminology is referred to as
    &lsquo;labour&rsquo;, &lsquo;birth&rsquo; and &lsquo;postpartum&rsquo;)
    we adopted some of the dais&rsquo; language of &lsquo;the opening
    body&rsquo;, &lsquo;the open body&rsquo;, and &lsquo;the closing
    body&rsquo;.
    <em>Narak</em>
    thus can be viewed as representing &lsquo;the open body&rsquo;. This is
    the time when what is normally closed (literally the cervix) is open,
    and that is the liminal and dangerous time/space of generative, female
    bodily processes.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Narak</em>
    also functions as a basic ethno-medical idea, providing a conceptual
    framework for a host of non-invasive therapeutic interventions.
    <em> Narak</em>
    signifies the inner world of the body, particularly the mysterious
    creative power of the female body (and simultaneously the earth body)
    invisible to the human eye. This concept allows for a mode of
    understanding facilitating non-invasive diagnostics and therapeutics.
    Dais practice gentle techniques to negotiate and affect the inner body
    without violating the integrity of the skin/body/life force. And indeed
    the dais&rsquo; holistic health modalities utilize touch (massage,
    pressure, manipulation), natural resources (mud, bath and fomentation,
    herbs), application of &lsquo;hot and cold&rsquo; (in food and drink,
    fomentation etc.) and behavioural changes (isolation and protection from
    domestic, maternal and sexual obligations).
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
	After delivery a woman is not given any grain or heavy food. This is
	called narak fasting (narak upwaas or fasting during the time of
	narak). Grain is only given on the third day after all the dirty blood
	comes out. On first day, she eats biscuits with tea. She drinks warm
	water. Second day, heat- producing balls made out of ginger, pepper,
	turmeric, roasted rice, milk and jaggery (saunth laddos). Third day,
	rice, lentil soup and vegetables. Rice is not given immediately after
	birth. First, we massage her. This relaxes her muscles, only after this
	she can digest her food. Turmeric lessens pain, dries the shareer
	(body, generally, and vagina/womb, specifically) and the saunth helps
	in forming milk (Pairia Devi, Bihar) <br /> <br /> It is called dirty
	blood because it has collected over nine months in the body. It is
	dark, smelly and clotted. It comes out first and then fresh clean blood
	comes out. With a little pressure and massage we take it out
	completely, and when the color of the blood becomes clear like monthly
	cycle we believe that it is clean. (Swarn Kaur, Punjab) <br /> <br />
	Gola is baby's home. When the house becomes empty, only dirty blood is
	left. When this comes out there is pain. Hot brew (ajwain, saunth,
	pipar and gur) is given. This drink cleans the belly. After the baby is
	born, the gola roams around. This gola has taken care of the baby, now
	it must leave. If the pain is intense then warm fomentation is done and
	gola melts away (pighal jata hai). This is dirty blood and needs
	cleaning up. (Kamala, Delhi) <br /> <br /> On the 13th day after
	birth, the new mother is allowed to enter the kitchen. (Chauka
	Charhana). Some do it on 7th or on 11th day. Everybody celebrates.
	There is singing and dancing. On this day the new mother and the baby
	bathe and wear new clothes. She comes out to get everyone's blessing.
	Friends and relatives are invited and eat food together. The Dai is
	given clothes, food and grain. (Punjab) <br /> <br /> On the day of
	the birth ritual celebration (Chhatti-6th day) the women wears
	everything that was taken off at the time of the birth. She put on <em>bindi</em>,
	bangles, henna and nose ring. We make ritual drawings of<em>
		Swasthik</em>, put ritual drawing here worship <em>Bemata</em> and light a
	lamp. We make a foot impression of the mother on the floor and then the
	woman enters the main house. Till the 5th day <em>Bemata</em> roams
	around in the house. After the birth celebrations <em>Bemata</em>
	leaves, she goes to another house. The <em>dai</em> also goes to serve
	others. (Paana, Rajasthan)
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
    <em>Narak</em>
    , as the unseen source of life and site of birth and death, provides a
    field for indigenous cultural reasoning to play. But this play is not
    simply fantasies of the imagination. It is an empirically grounded
    mapping of female physiological processes. And this mapping allows for
    the sophisticated indigenous reasoning system of diagnostics and
    therapeutics, as shown above.
    <em>Narak</em>
    provides space for intuition, imagination, other epistemologies and
    other therapies. Female embodiment is known and respected. Dignity is
    bestowed on human qualities: the need for affectionate touch; processing
    and expressing emotion; the reality of physical sensation. Conceptual
    categorization does not dominate and attempt to control female
    physiological processes.
    <em>Narak</em>
    and
    <em>Bemata</em>
    can hold both ethno-medical knowledge and the mysteries inherent in the
    birth process.
</p>

<p>
    The challenge to biomedical practitioners and public health
    professionals, as well as policymakers at all levels is the creation of
    a vital interface, a placenta &ndash; if you will, between themselves and
    the women who bear and deliver the majority of the babies born in India.
    We must learn to speak the languages of placenta and
    <em>narak</em>.
