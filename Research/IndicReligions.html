<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
    This utterance, by a Mazbi Sikh dai in a MATRIKA workshop with 24 dais
    held in Fategarh Sahib Gurdwara provides an entry point for
    investigation of the sacred in these mainly low and outcaste
    women&rsquo;s birth work, ritual and beliefs &ndash; and the three are an
    inseparable whole. This holism is as incomprehensible to the bio-medical
    health establishment as it is to priests, mullahs, pundits and others
    functionaries of &lsquo;religious&rsquo; authorities. Actually the
    rupture of healing and spirituality, of the doctors and the priests, a
    product of modernity is even displayed in the offerings at this
    conference. How can we represent Indic religions, without reference to
    its thousands if not millions of dais, malish wallahs, herbalists,
    ojahs, pirs, hakims, vaidyas, etc and their religious and indigenous
    medical practice?
</p>

<p>
    MATRIKA (Motherhood and Traditional Resources, Information, Knowledge,
    and Action) was a 3-year participatory action research project in
    collaboration with four local NGOs. MATRIKA is named after a group of
    female figures, usually either seven or eight, depicted in sculpture and
    myth as collective and semi-divine beings &ndash; and associated with
    mothering. The Matrika ../images include voluptuous beauties &ndash; one
    with an infant, theriomorphic (human body with animal head) figures and
    a wizened crone (for more detail see Panniker, 1997).
</p>

<p>
    We collaborated with grassroots based NGOs: Action India (working in the
    slums of Delhi); Mahila Jagriti Kendra (South Bihar); Voluntary Health
    Association of Punjab (Fategarh District) and URMUL (Rajasthan). The NGO
    called together dais who were considered by local women to be
    experienced and knowledgeable for a series of three workshops. In these
    workshops we posed the question &lsquo;what does a woman need during
    pregnancy, birth and postpartum?&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
    The attitudes of our team members were crucial to the success of the
    research work. We consciously cultivated an ethos in which we were open
    to religio-cultural ways of thinking and doing &lsquo;health&rsquo; and
    assumed that these poor, illiterate, low caste women were the inheritors
    of India&rsquo;s midwifery traditions.
</p>

<p>
    Our activities included role-plays, ritual drawings, body mapping,
    singing of birth songs, sharing of birth experiences (ours and theirs)
    as well as dais&rsquo; life narratives. . Group discussions,
    interpreting role-plays and other data, were at the heart of our
    activities. We were able to access, and remain with, this alien (to us)
    information because we did not limit ourselves by separating data into
    mutually exclusive categories of &lsquo;medicine&rsquo; and
    &lsquo;religion&rsquo;. Rather we were receptive to diverse ways of
    facilitating birth, diagnosing and healing &ndash; to ritual enactments,
    notions of deities and demons, bhut-pret (ghosts and spirits) and the
    nazar or evil eye. We attempted to let the data speak the categories
    rather than the categories shape the data. This paper is drawn from that
    data.
</p>

<p>
    In this paper we are not just demolishing the line between the sacred
    and the profane, between the pure and the impure, between swarg and
    narak &ndash; rather we are asserting the lived sacrality inherent in
    beliefs about and rituals accompanying women&rsquo;s biological
    processes--menstruation and childbirth.
</p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>
    Ritual is belief in practice. It is very tempting for us modern women to
    stand outside of ideas of the &lsquo;dirty&rsquo; female body and
    critique the &lsquo;confinement&rsquo; of women at the time of
    menstruation and birth as archaic and misogynist. Having listened
    carefully to dais&rsquo; voices, and paid attention to Indian and
    sub-continental representation systems for almost 30 years I am now
    adamantly against doing so. The project of modernity has displaced
    valuable indigenous resources, &lsquo;cultural capital&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
    Most of us are aware of the critical evaluation and devaluation by the
    Arya Samaj of household ritual and devotional puja in their return to
    the &lsquo;original&rsquo; and &lsquo;pure&rsquo; Vedic Hinduism. Their
    re-scripting of hymns expunged passion and metaphors of the body.
    Dualistic, god- disembodied and devotee as well. In this theology
    &lsquo;aap&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;Tu &rdquo; were used to address the
    divine.
</p>

<p>
    Likewise the Brahmo Samaj did away with ritualism, in weddings the
    calash was banished along with the saptapadi, seven steps. Of course
    Tantric and Shaktic rites and beliefs were also &lsquo;impure&rsquo;.
    Both movements valorized the rational, scientific temper and drew from
    urban upper castes and classes. And furthered the chasm between
    co-religionists &ndash; fragmenting common religiosities. But few are
    aware of the negative impact that this &lsquo;progressive&rsquo;
    ideology had on women&rsquo;s bodily observances, beliefs and rituals.

<h3>
	Displaced Ontologies and Epistomologies<br /> The sacred other, sacred
	nature and the ontology of &lsquo;inanimate objects&rsquo;
</h3>

<p>
    <em>Dai Ma, Dharti Ma</em>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
	<em>Dai pyar se samjhati hai<br /> Sahalati hai aur sambhalti
		hai.<br /> Ghanton jachche ke paas rahti hai<br /> Dai jachche aur
		bachche ko sahara deti hai <br /> Jaise Dharti humko sahara deti hai
	</em><br /> <br /> <em>O! Mother Dai you are like the Earth<br />
		You care for us, understand us.<br /> You sit with us for hours and
		support us<br /> Just like the earth gives us support.
	</em>
</p>

<p>
    Similarly we find this ontological perspective in the theology of
    Bemata, the divine, and sometimes demonic, figure traditionally invoked
    by dais at the time of birth.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Bemata</em>
    is not like Durga or Saraswati, Lakshmi or even Santoshi Ma. To my
    knowledge there exist no temples, pilgrimage sites, texts, icons
    relating to Bemata, nor does she have a place in the ritual calendar.
    She cannot even be said to be aniconic &ndash; found in the form of a
    stone or a cave. If she represents anything, it is female reproductive
    physiology. As mentioned above she manifests as both a creative and a
    destructive force &ndash; procreativity while growing the baby, and
    pathology if she does not leave when her work is done.
</p>

<p>
    I first encountered Bemata 15 years ago in a collaborative research
    project with NGOs documenting women&rsquo;s experiences of childbearing.
    In these interviews, conducted by health workers who were themselves
    <em>basti</em> residents, women spoke of Bemata as she was invoked during a ritual I
    call &ldquo;the cutting of the <em>atta</em>
     &rdquo;. Moti <em> Dai</em> describes the rite invoking Bemata emphasizing that the
    <em>dai</em>, herself, is empowered by <em>Bemata</em>.
</p>

<p>
    There is the custom of cutting the
    <em> atta</em>
    or rice. When the labour pains have come and the dai has arrived, the
    jachcha puts both hands full of
    <em>atta</em>
    in the
    <em>thali</em>
    . The dai holds the wrist of the mother while she, with her hand,
    separates the atta into two parts from the middle. Bemata is worshipped
    by putting money and gur on top of the
    <em>atta</em>
    , offering it to the dai, and saying &ldquo;In this way separate the
    mother and the child so that the child is born without any
    difficulty. &rdquo; It is said that when Ram and Lakshman were born
    Bemata herself came and acted as
    <em>dai</em>
    . Now it&rsquo;s the dai, herself, who represents the shakti of Bemata.
    (Moti
    <em> Dai</em>
     &ndash; an upper caste midwife)
</p>

<p>
    Moti
    <em>Dai</em>
    , a rare high caste midwife, connects the ritual with the midwife who
    assisted Sita at Ram and Lakshman&rsquo;s births. Shakina
    <em> Dai,</em>
    a Muslim midwife, mentions offerings to
    <em>Sayyid</em>
    , an Islamic figure, but similarly invokes Bemata. She also refers to
    the labouring woman as having one foot in heaven and the other in
    <em>narak</em>
    or hell.
</p>

<p>
    Look, sister, at the time of birth it&rsquo;s only the woman&rsquo;s
    <em>Shakti</em>
    . She who gives birth, at that time, her one foot is in heaven and the
    other, in hell. The woman&rsquo;s
    <em>Shakti</em>
    is indeed a lot when she gives birth to a child. Before doing a delivery
    I.get the woman to open all the trunks, doors and so on. I pray to the
    One Above to open the knot quickly. I take off the sari, open the hair
    and take off the bangles or any jewellery. I put the
    <em>atta</em>
    on a
    <em>thali</em>
    and ask the woman to divide it into two equal parts. Also I get Rs.1.25
    in the name of
    <em>Sayyid</em>
    kept separately. But mostly I remember Bemata. Repeatedly I pray to the
    <em>Bemata</em>
    &ldquo;Oh mother! please open the knot quickly. &rdquo; (
    <em>Shakina Dai</em>
     &ndash; a Muslim midwife)
</p>

<p>
    <em>Dais</em>
    from all religions have invoked Bemata. In workshops in the Punjab,
    Mazbi (outcaste)
    <em>Sikh dais</em>
    said that they, too, pray to Bemata.
</p>

<p>
    In our first MATRIKA workshop with
    <em>dais</em>
    from Delhi slums we were told:
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
	<em>Bemata</em> is an old woman, has white hair and walks with the help
	of a stick. She stays under the earth and makes <em>putle</em>
	(puppets) and gives them to people. She gives to some people and does
	not give to others. When a baby smiles, it is believed that <em>Bemata</em>
	is making her smile.
</p>

<p>
    Imaged as a playful and rather fickle old woman, Bemata is amazingly
    familiar and at the same time a divine persona. She is invoked at the
    time of childbirth being the special patron of dais and parturient
    women. Living underground, she creates human beings out of earth,
    breathing life into them and writes their fate on their foreheads
    shortly after birth. Bemata is immanent in all nature, grows and
    protects the baby in the womb, but also seems to be responsible for
    complications if she does not &lsquo;exit&rsquo; the mother&rsquo;s body
    via postpartum bleeding. She is understood to leave the birth home at
    the time of the Chatti rite, six days after birth when she is thanked
    for growing and protecting the baby. However, she is also perceived as
    being responsible for diseases of mother and child in the postpartum
    period. Theologically, it is important to note that the presence of the
    same force that is seen as benign and fecund at one time (pregnancy and
    birth) becomes destructive and dangerous at another (post birth) if she
    is not in the process of diminishing or leaving. Thus the divine/demonic
    valence of Bemata is entirely contextual and time-dependent.
</p>

<p>
    These kinds of conflations, were de-ligitimized by the rationalist,
    scientific mindset and the disembodied religiosity propounded by the
    modernists.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>The conflation of the female body and the earth &ndash; Reclaiming narak</strong>
</p>

<p>
    <strong><em>Narak Quotes</em></strong>
    <br>
    The following data from our workshop transcripts present meanings of
    narak. These quotes from Bihar speak explicitly, using the word
    &lsquo;narak.&rsquo; In other areas the meanings are more implicit in
    the practices and the &lsquo;dirtiness&rsquo; associated with times of
    female fertility.
</p>

<p>
    Girls are considered holy before puberty. The marriage of a young girl,
    who has not had her periods, is performed with her sitting on her
    father&rsquo;s lap. After puberty the woman is considered unclean, and
    is unholy, because she bleeds, and this is
    <em>narak</em>.
</p>

<p>
    On
    <em>Chhati</em>
    day the narak period ends. The
    <em> Dai</em>
    checks if the umbilical cord has fallen off. Then she bathes the baby
    and beats a
    <em> thaali</em>
    (plate). After this the woman is bathed and wears new clothes. The
    <em>dai</em>
    cleans the room where the delivery took place and the woman was kept
    separately for six days. The dirty clothes of mother and child are
    washed. After this the
    <em>dai</em>
    is given soap and oil for bathing. All this is on the sixth day after
    delivery.
</p>

<p>
    Although often translated as hellish or demonic place,
    <em>narak</em>
    can be understood as the site or energy of the unseen inner world - of
    the earth and of the body, particularly the fertile and bleeding female
    body.
    <em>Narak</em>
    has the connotation &lsquo;filth&rsquo; but also signifies the fertility
    or fruitful potential of the earth and woman. So-called &lsquo;pollution
    taboos&rsquo; are related to
    <em>narak</em>
     &ndash; where the idea of the sacred is radically separated from the
    reproductive potential of the female body. During menstruation and
    post-birth women are &lsquo;unclean&rsquo;. However the dai speaks with
    a very different voice than the pundit about this uncleanness, this
    <em>narak</em>
    . To her the placenta, the ultimate polluting substance in the
    <em>shastra</em>
    literature, is spoken of reverently. It is no coincidence that
    <em>dais</em>
    are mainly from low and outcaste communities. Both caste and gender are
    involved in concepts of narak.
</p>

<p>
    Despite the pejorative connotations of the word
    <em> narak</em>
    , the concept has allowed for abiding female spaces and birth cultures.
    In the &lsquo;male&rsquo; or &lsquo;dominant&rsquo; view these female
    times are &lsquo;filthy&rsquo; or polluted, but they are also times when
    masculine, social and even familial demands on women are suspended. And
    traditionally older women guarded these spaces from any
    incursions &ndash; perhaps with the help of &lsquo;demons&rsquo; and
    nether forces!? Within this imagistic representation, the nature of
    female bodily energy is understood as &lsquo;out of
    control&rsquo; &ndash; women are presumed to be more emotional and have
    special physical needs at this time &ndash; so the usual social
    constraints are suspended. Of course we need to interrogate the priestly
    voice and de-sacralisation of menstruation and birth &ndash; but we should
    not throw out the baby with the bathwater. We should not ignore the
    traditional birth knowledge of India.
</p>

<p>
    Conversely the fertility of land and woman are acknowledged and honored.
    Both are &lsquo;fruitful&rsquo; and this is not simply a symbolic
    device. Within indigenous medical traditions such as Ayurveda, and with
    the dais, a totally different ontological system is at work. Woman is
    not a &lsquo;symbol&rsquo; of the earth. Nor is the earth a
    &lsquo;symbol&rsquo; of woman. Rather they both partake of the same
    nature of fecundity. Just as the wind outside my window partakes of the
    same essence as the breath which flows in and out of my lungs.
</p>

<p>
    During
    <em>narak</em>
    time what is usually closed, the womb, is open, raw, vulnerable and
    bleeding.
    <em>Narak</em>
    allows for the imaging of the unseen &ndash; and the use of other senses,
    besides the visual, as well as the human capacities of empathy and
    imagination in diagnostics and therapeutics. And in fact
    <em>narak</em>
    is deeply implicated in the handling of postpartum care.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
	After delivery a woman is not given any grain or heavy food. This is
	called<em> narak</em> fasting. Grain is only given on the third day
	after all the dirty blood comes out. On first day, she eats biscuits
	with tea. She drinks warm water. Second day, heat-producing balls made
	out of ginger, pepper, turmeric, roasted rice, milk and jaggery (<em>saunth
		laddos</em>). On the third day, rice, dal and vegetables. (Bihar)<br /> It
	is called dirty blood because it has collected over nine months in the
	body. It is dark, smelly and clotted. It comes out first and then fresh
	clean blood comes out. <br /> <br /> With a little pressure and
	massage we take it out completely, and when the color of the blood
	becomes clear like monthly cycle we believe that it is clean. (Punjab)<br />
	<em>Gola </em>is baby's home. When the house becomes empty, only dirty
	blood is left. When this comes out there is pain. Hot drinks (of <em>ajwain</em>,
	<em>saunth</em>, <em>pipar</em> and<em> gur</em>) are given. This drink
	cleans the belly. After the baby is born, the gola roams around. This <em>gola</em>
	has taken care of the baby, now it must leave. If the pain is intense
	then warm fomentation is done and gola melts away (<em>pighal jata
		hai</em>). This is dirty blood and needs cleaning up. (Delhi)
</p>

<p>
    Perhaps in the dominant world religions (Judeo-Christian-Islamic and
    Hinduism, or more correctly Brahminism) the concept of
    <em> narak</em>
    or &lsquo;hell&rsquo; overlays previous meaning systems which
</p>

<p>
    Concepts of &lsquo;pollution taboo&rsquo; mask sophisticated bodily
    praxis involving parturient women. Isolation postpartum and during
    menses allows a woman to withdraw her attention from the everyday world
    and its demands into the experience of female physiological functioning,
    thus providing not only rest but also a kind of meditation on body
    cosmos connections. Interestingly these changes are understood to
    produce a cleansing &lsquo;heat&rsquo; within the body, akin to the
    yogic tapasya.
</p>

<h3>Dais&rsquo; work as &lsquo;Sewa ka Kam&rsquo;</h3>

<p>
    Dais with whom MATRIKA interacted spoke of their work attending births
    as &lsquo;sewa ka kam.&rsquo; Inserted within its own religio-cultural
    and indigenous medical, as well as socio-economic context the work of
    birth is one of service. As one dai said to us &ldquo;How can I not come
    to the side of a woman who is giving birth just because she is
    poor? &rdquo; Another spoke of using her own oil and actually giving
    money to a new mother totally without resources. Subhadra Rai elaborates
    this orientation towards dai work.
</p>

<p>
    Dais&rsquo; own perceptions of their care work are couched in
    socio-cultural terms of
    <em> poonya ka kaam</em>
    (good work),
    <em>dharm</em>
    (duty, religion), blessings, happiness, help the poor, and reciprocity.
    These terms take precedence over other valuations of their work. It is
    not that monetary payment is unimportant or secondary, but
    contextualising their work within the sociocultural framework becomes
    easier in the society in which they operate.
</p>

<p>
    The ritual practice, conflations of female body and earth, dai ma and
    dharti ma, as well as notions of narak as embodied female experience all
    allow us to reconfigure the conventional notions of female
    &lsquo;impurity. The dai, and traditional women&rsquo;s bodily praxis
    during menses and postpartum express a poetics and sacrality of the body
    foreign to the modern, scientific and &lsquo;rational&rsquo; mind, as
    well as the Brahmanic and textual orientation of &lsquo;Hinduism&rsquo;.
    Unfortunately displacement of these religio-cultural practices and
    beliefs has abdicated definitions of the procreative female body to the
    pollution of the priests and the pathology of the bio-medical
    practitioners. We are all bereft of positive imagery, the hands on
    care-taking and location in the cosmic play of creativity and
    generativity which has marked women&rsquo;s ritual performances and the
    beliefs they celebrate.
