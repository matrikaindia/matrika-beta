PHILADELPHIA, PA Summer 2002 &ndash; University of Pennsylvania Museum
archaeologists have discovered a 3700-year-old &quot;magical&quot; birth
brick inside the palatial residence of a Middle Kingdom mayor&rsquo;s
house just outside Abydos, in southern Egypt. The colorfully decorated
mud birth brick &ndash; the first ever found &ndash; is one of a pair that
would have been used to support a woman&rsquo;s feet while squatting
during actual childbirth.
<br />
<br />
The birth brick, which measures 14 by 7 inches, was discovered during
summer 2001 excavations directed by Dr. Josef Wegner, Associate Curator,
Egyptian section of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology
and Anthropology. The ancient brick still preserves colorful painted
scenes and figures: clearly visible is a mother holding her newborn
baby, as well as magical images of gods whose role was to protect and
aid the mother and baby at the time of birth.
<br />
<br />
According to Dr. Wegner, Egyptologists have long known, from ancient
texts, that the standard form of childbirth in ancient Egypt was for the
woman to deliver the baby while squatting on two mud bricks. The upper
surface of the birth brick discovered at Abydos, unlike the bottom and
sides, is crumbled away. &quot;It is quite possible,&quot; Dr Wegner
notes, &quot;that the damage to the top of the brick  &ndash; and another
like it that has not been preserved &ndash;  was caused by its use to
support a woman's feet in childbirth for a long period of time and
during multiple deliveries.&quot;
<br />
<br />
<em><strong>And whose birth brick was this?</strong></em>
Dr. Wegner and the Penn excavation team have a pretty good idea of who
may have used the birth brick: a noblewoman and princess named Renseneb.
Back in the summer of 1999, the Penn team discovered (from seal
impressions with hieroglyphic texts and other objects) that the
grandiose building they were excavating was, in fact, the mayor&rsquo;s
residence &ndash; the first ancient Egyptian mayor&rsquo;s residence ever
positively identified. The birth brick recently unearthed was in an area
clearly identified as a female residential section of the house.
Numerous inscribed clay seal impressions found in this area have the
name of the &quot;noblewoman and king's daughter Renseneb.&quot; Dr.
Wegner suspects that this woman, who lived during Egypt's 13th Dynasty,
may have been a princess who was married to one of the town's mayors.

<br />
The Egyptians likened the birth of a child to the rising of the sun at
daybreak. The magical practices of childbirth were intended to protect a
newborn baby in a way paralleling Egyptian myths where the young sun god
required protection from hostile forces. On the birth brick from the
Abydos excavation the sun god appears in symbolic form in the guise of a
desert cat. Images of the guardians of the sun god decorate the sides of
the brick, to magically provide similar protection for mother and child,
according to Dr. Wegner.
<br />
<br />
One set of objects closely associated with the recently discovered birth
brick are magical wands usually decorated with scenes of deities and
demons--and the Penn excavators have discovered fragments of these as
well in the mayor's residence. Egyptologists know that such wands were
used in a form of &quot;sympathetic magic&quot; that invoked divine
forces to protect the newborn baby at the time of birth in the same way,
according to Egyptian myth, that the allies of the sun god would protect
him when he was young and vulnerable.

<strong>Pushpa</strong>
: &ldquo;It is easier to deliver by squatting on bricks. It is easy to
push this way. There is always another woman to give support. When the
pains start, she sits and holds the birthing woman. &rdquo;(Delhi)
<br />
<br />
<strong>Munni</strong>
: &ldquo;I also had my baby on bricks. You can put pressure more easily.
It&rsquo;s not as easy while lying on a cot. The
<em>jacha</em>
is made to squat on the bricks only when the baby&rsquo;s head starts
showing. With the third pain, the baby comes out. &rdquo;(Delhi)
