title: Birth Weight

<p>
    A University of
    California study that included 250 pregnant women showed that an
    infant's birth weight may be affected by the amount of social
    support the mother receives during pregnancy. The women were
    asked if the baby's father would help them financially and
    otherwise with the baby, if their parents would be there for
    them, and if they had friends to turn to for support and
    assistance. The study found that women with several types of
    support from various sources during pregnancy had higher birth
    weight infants. The relationship between social support and birth
    weight held even after the researchers took into account other
    factors often associated with low birth weight, including
    premature delivery, a history of stillbirth or spontaneous
    abortion, and medical conditions such as hypertension or
    epilepsy. The researchers speculated that social support may
    alter responses of the nervous system to stress and improve fetal
    growth. Social support may also inspire healthier behaviors and
    lifestyles among pregnant women and discourage high-risk
    behaviors such as smoking, substance use, and poor nutritional
    intake. Pregnant women with more social support may also be more
    likely to receive treatment for diseases associated with low
    infant birth weight.
