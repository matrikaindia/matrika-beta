<h1>Did You Know?</h1>

<h2>Yoni as source</h2>

<p>
    The root of &lsquo;yoni&rsquo; is the Sanskrit word
    (and Hindi?) &lsquo;yuj&rsquo; meaning &lsquo;to unite&rsquo;. The yoni is the crucible
    where things are combined (male and female, mother and
    fetus) where creation and re-creation takes place.

    The yoni is also the
    place where each menstruating woman may experience the cosmic
    cycles of creation-sustaining-destruction of potential human
    life - the egg cell.

    Yoni signifies both
    vagina and womb. In the traditional cosmo-vision it is where the
    spirit world (or the unborn, the ancestors) meet the
    flesh-and-blood reality of the material world.

                occurrences and also sacred. As Pyar Kaur said in our MATRIKA
                Punjab workshop &lsquo;To have a child is important even for a
                millionaire. This work is precious because that part of the
                body, which is covered all the time is unveiled to bring in
                life to this world.&rsquo;

                Lal Ded was
                a Kashmiri mystic of the 14th Century honoured by Hindus and
                Muslims alike. She is said to have shown her guru, who was
                performing a lunar fast, how the penance should really be
                practiced. She placed an earthen pot on her head and another
                under her feet; and with the waning of the moon, her body waned
                till, on the fifteenth night of the dark fortnight (Amavasya),
                nothing was left of her except a little quantity of trembling
                quicksilver. Then, with the waxing moon her body waxed and, on
                the full moon night, she was herself again. This is an obvious
                allusion to her observing nature, the lunar cycles, as they
                moved through her body.
