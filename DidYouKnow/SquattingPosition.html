<h1>Did You Know?</h1>

<h2>Did you know about the use of the squatting position at the time of birth?</h2>

<p>
Many midwives and mothers recognize squatting at the time of birth as
having many advantages.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Gravity works for, not against as in the lithotomy position
		where the mother is literally pushing the baby UP against gravity, the
		expulsion of the baby.
	</li>
	<li>The pelvic outlet is at its widest in the squatting position,
		allowing the babyï¿½s bony structures to move through the mothers pelvic
		bones, many times avoiding CPD or ephalo-pelvic disproportion.
	</li>
	<li>Women are often supported by attendants offering both physical
		support and affectionate touch, encouraging the mother in her pushing
		efforts.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
Two public health doctors in India have researched the effectiveness of
this method of birthing and published their findings in this little
book.
