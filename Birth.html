	<em>&ldquo;At the time of delivery, her legs start shaking; she
		has pains in her entire lower back and waist area. The backs of the
		thighs are massaged. The backs of the thighs are massaged. This is
		done the way jachcha desires. At the time of birth the mother&rsquo;s
		body is coming to its fullness &#8211; the baby&rsquo;s head fills the
		pelvic area (sharer ubharta hai). The baby starts coming out, its head
		can be seen. At this time we help with our hands. Water keeps on
		flowing. &rdquo;</em> <em>&#8211;<strong> Mohini Rajasthan</strong></em><br />
	<br /> <em>&ldquo;When jachcha gets tired during birth, we press
		her belly. This gives her a little support. If the bag of water
		breaks, then delivery should happen within half an hour otherwise the
		water may enter into baby&rsquo;s eyes, nose, mouth and this can be
		dangerous for the baby. Sometimes after water bag breaks, the head can
		be seen. We ask the women to push hard to hasten delivery. If she gets
		tired then we hold her belly and legs and help her to push. She is
		reassured; she feels that somebody is supporting her. If the head is
		stuck in the birth canal for a longer time then it gets
		elongated. &rdquo; &#8211;<strong>Kheevni Rjasthan </strong>

<h2>Knowledge and Skills</h2>
&ldquo;The
<em>Dai</em>
massages
<em> jachcha&rsquo;s</em>
perineum with
<em>ghee</em>
or oil, so that it becomes flexible. &rdquo; &#8211;Delhi
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;When birth begins the
<em>Dai</em>
massages the perineum with oil. &rdquo; &#8211;Bihar
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;The
<em>Dai</em>
massages her, presses her feet against the anus. We make the woman squat
on the bricks, the cloth is pressed against the anus and the baby is
delivered smoothly. By counter pressure the baby moves downwards, in the
birth canal. &rdquo; &#8211;Kesari, Rjasthan
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;We put a piece of cloth on the anus and push it upward. This
helps the baby to move through the vaginal passage. Women themselves say
that they feel pressure there (the anus) so please press it. &rdquo;
&#8211;Praveen, Delhi
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;See, this is the wonder of nature. At the time, when the baby is
coming, even the anus comes down. Its mouth widens. However, the baby
cannot come out from there, The woman will die. So a piece of cloth is
pressed against the anus. We place it with out heel. Lot of pressure is
applied so the anus is raised up. &rdquo;- Dhapo, Delhi
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;No
<em>Dai</em>
tells a woman to push unless the contractions are hard. &rdquo; &#8211;
Delhi
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;When a woman starts getting pains, we massage her back. We give
her hot tea or milk to sip. When the pains become strong then we make
her squat on the bricks. This position helps putting pressure
downwards. &rdquo; &#8211;Kako, Punjab
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;When she observes that the woman is ready to deliver, the
<em>Dai</em>
ask her to squat on the two bricks, or to lie down. She exercises her
judgment. Traditionally squatting is preferred, but if the woman is weak
or has given birth to many children or has a history of prolapsed
uterus, it is considered better that she lie for birth. &rdquo; &#8211;
Delhi
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;We make use of various birth positions depending on the
mother&rsquo;s condition. If the woman is made to lie down, is in a
direction along the direction of the beam of the house, lengthwise. This
positioning places the mother&rsquo;s body along the same axis as the
house beam - straight. So the mother&rsquo;s body lies in relation to
the house as the baby&rsquo;s body should be within its
&#8216;house&rsquo; &#8211; the mother. &rdquo; &#8211;Bihar
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;When we find the woman absolutely ready to deliver, only then we
tell her to push. Many
<em>Dais</em>
relate that there are three strong contractions. During the third, baby
is delivered. &rdquo; &#8211;Delhi
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wear gloves as I get confused about what I am
feeling. I can usually make out by feeling with my hands. Once I was
wearing gloves and the buttocks were coming out. But I thought it was
head. Soon I realized what was happening, but everybody else panicked.
Still I held the lower back of the jachcha and worked with her, and then
the baby came out fine. But because of wearing gloves I got cheated (got
wrong information). &rdquo; &#8211;Kaushalaya, Delhi.
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;The first child takes a long time. The subsequent children do not
take so long. We can tell by feeling at the opening. If it is coming
head first then we will feel hair. If it is feet first, then it will
feel slippery. &#8211;Shakuntala Devi, Bihar
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;The
<em>Dai</em>
and other women support the
<em>jachcha</em>
throughout the birth. If the woman is squatting, then one attendant is
at her back, providing pressure at the lower back. The Dai sits in front
so that the woman may lean on her during a contraction. &rdquo;
&#8211;Delhi
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;The jachcha and the
<em>Dai</em>
sit in front of each other. When
<em>jachcha</em>
is lying down, Dai puts her legs against her inner thighs. This allows
her to push more effectively. &rdquo; &#8211; Kaushalaya, Delhi
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Jachcha holds
<em>Dai</em>
around the neck and gives a strong push. &rdquo; &#8211;Dhapo, Delhi
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;This is my personal experience; I had my baby, squatting on the
bricks. You can bear down better that way. It is not that easy lying on
a cot. &rdquo; &#8211;Munni, Delhi
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;They squat on the bricks only if the baby is not coming out
properly, if the pains are not strong enough to push the baby out. If it
is happening easily then we make her lie on the cot. When the head is
out then oil or ghee is applied on the perineum. The baby&rsquo;s body
slips out properly. &rdquo; &#8211;Vidya Devi, Delhi
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;
<em>Dai</em>
tells jachcha to sit, one person holds her from the back. The
<em>Dai</em>
supports from the front. The woman is asked to lie down if there is a
lot of difficulty. &rdquo; &#8211;Bihar
<br />
<br />
<em>Dai</em>
helps the woman with her legs. She sits and places her own legs on the
inside portion of the woman&rsquo;s thighs, so the mother can bear down
more effectively, and the birth takes place. &rdquo; -Rajasthan
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;When the head of the baby comes low then if the buttocks are
pressed then baby will rotate and come out. &rdquo; &#8211;Kamala, delhi
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;We support the woman and let the baby come out on its own,. When
we see the head coming then we make her squat and once the head is out
we make her lie down. &rdquo; &#8211; Kako, Punjab
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;When we see that the head is nearly out but some help is needed,
then only we try to make space with our fingers. &rdquo; &#8211;Punjab

<h2>Emotional &amp; Social Support</h2>
&ldquo;We believe that the deliver happens smoothly if there is no
shouting. &rdquo; &#8211; Tara, Delhi
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;The
<em>Dai</em>
sometimes pushes along with the woman as if she herself were having a
baby. &rdquo; &#8211; Bihar
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;When
<em>jachcha</em>
starts asking for her mother and father, then we give her reassurance.
We tell her that it happens to everyone. It happened to this woman and
to that woman. I name women whom she knows and say that I was there for
her birth. I tell her that everyone gets these pains. Even I had them.
We tell her that she should juts bear it and soon the baby will be
delivered. We keep saying &ldquo;Here comes the baby, here it
comes. &rdquo; We message her and stoke her. &rdquo; &#8211; Kheevni,
Rajasthan
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;The main words used by the
<em>Dais</em>
are &ldquo;slowly, slowly, slowly &rdquo; (
<em>dhire, dhire, dhire</em>
). &rdquo; &#8211; Bihar

<h2>Ritual and Body Imagery</h2>
<div>
	<img src="/assets/images/image005-h.gif" width="350" height="250"
		class="floatRight" /> &ldquo;During birth, the <em>Dai</em> prays to
	Bemata. The belief is that the time is ripe, Bemata will send the baby.
	No sooner, and no later, it is liberation for the baby freedom from the
	nine month&rsquo;s underground or health pond (<em>nau maheene ka
		narak kund</em>). &rdquo; &#8211;Delhi <br /> <br /> &ldquo;We bow to
	Mother Earth (<em>Dharti Ma</em>), for it is believed that it is earth
	that is giving birth to the child. <em>Dharti Ma</em> is like a mother.
	Like a mother gives birth, the Earth also gives birth. &rdquo;
	&#8211;Bihar <br /> <br /> &ldquo;There is a separate room for
	delivery. At the time of delivery the <em>Dai</em> remembers all her <em>Devi-Devata</em>.
	With folded hand we pray respect to <em>Bemata</em> and <em>Dharti
		Mat</em>a. &rdquo; &#8211;Kheevni, Rajasthan
