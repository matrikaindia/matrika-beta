<h2>Punjab socio-economic report (Fategarh District)</h2>

<h3>Geography and History</h3>

<p>
	Fategarh District of Punjab is named after the
	historic Gurdwara which is called &ldquo;Fategarh Sahib &rdquo;. This
	Gurdwara marks the site where in 1705 the two youngest sons of Guru
	Gobind Singh (the tenth and last of the Sikh Gurus) were martyred by
	being walled in alive. These children refused to convert to Islam and
	were thus executed by the order of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. Our
	MATRIKA team felt quite emotional upon accompanying the dais and
	descending below the ground in the Gurdwara to pay homage at the
	exposed brick wall where this sacrifice is remembered and meditated
	upon. We also prayed at the smaller Mata Gujri Gurdwara which
	commemorates the Guru&#8217;s mother (the boys&#8217;
	grandmother) &ndash; who according to legend counselled the young
	martyrs to remain faithful to their beliefs and to accept their death.
	It seemed profoundly significant to hold a workshop on childbirth with
	traditional midwives at a place associated with the death of young
	children &ndash; and a place considered sacred by the midwives
	themselves.
</p>

<p>
	Formerly designated Sirhind, Fategarh District
	lies 50 kilometers West of Chandigarh and was the capital of the
	Pathan Suri dynasty. Humayan defeated Sikundar Shah here in 1555 which
	led to the establishment of the Mughal dynasty. Under the Mughal
	sovereigns Sirhind was one of the most flourishing towns of the empire
	and British gazetteers noted that it contained 360 mosques, tombs,
	sarais and wells. These ruins, which our MATRIKA team explored during
	workshop breaks, commence about a mile from the railway station and
	extend for several miles.
</p>

<p>
	In 1995 Fategarh became a separate district
	which now covers 1,180 square kilometres with a population of
	approximately 5,00,000. Agriculture, which is the mainstay of
	Punjab&rsquo;s economy, is the predominant occupation of Fategarh
	District. The fertility of the soil and industriousness of the people
	is demonstrated by the fact that in 1997-1998 Punjab contributed 68%
	of the wheat and 35% of the rice to the central pool whereas it only
	comprises 1.5% of the land. Wheat, legumes, maize, groundnut, red
	chili and some rice are grown in the Fategarh area. Although primarily
	known for its agriculture Punjab also has some thriving
	industries &ndash; including Hero bicycles at Ludhiana, India&rsquo;s
	(and the world&rsquo;s) largest bicycle manufacturer.
</p>

<p>
	The Punjab was probably the part of India which
	suffered most destruction and damage at the time of Partition, yet
	today it is by far the most affluent state in India. Prior to
	Partition in 1947 the Punjab extended across both sides of what is now
	the India-Pakistan border. And Lahore, now capital of the Pakistani
	state of Punjab, was then capital of Undivided Punjab. The grim logic
	of Partition sliced the Punjab into a Muslim region (Pakistan) and a
	Sikh and Hindu region (India). As millions of Sikhs and Hindus fled
	eastward, and equal numbers of Muslims fled west, there were
	innumerable atrocities and killings on both sides. Indeed late into
	one night during the workshop the VHAP and MATRIKA team listened to
	the stories of two elderly dais as they recounted their experiences of
	Partition.
</p>
	
<p>
	More recently Sikh political demands have
	impacted the state. Militants, originally protesting the dominance and
	economic exploitation of the Central government, have waged an
	agitation for more autonomy for the Punjab. And for the creation of a
	separate and independent Sikh state to be called Khalistan (land of
	the pure).
</p>

<h3>Annual Religious Fairs and Festivals of Fategarh</h3>

<p>
	The usual Dussehra and Diwali festivals of
	Hindus are celebrated in the fall. The principle,and now the only,
	area festival celebrated by Muslims is the Urs Rauza Sharif which
	falls in the month of Safar of the Hijri Era and lasts for three days.
	It is estimated that about a thousand people attend from India and
	abroad. But none of the above compare with the Jor-Mela of the Sikhs.
	This event falls on 27th December and is held to commemorate the
	execution of the two young sons, Zorawar Singh and Fateh Singh. The
	program includes a huge procession, bathing in the sacred tank
	attached to the Gurdwara, a complete recital of the entire Granth
	Sahib (the Sikh Holy Book), kirtan or the singing of the Guru&rsquo;s
	hymns and lectures. In recent years the gatherings of large numbers at
	a single place has begun to be utilised by political parties to
	propagate their respective political agendas.
</p>

<h3>Sikhism</h3>

<p>
	The majority of the dais attending our workshop
	in Punjab were Sikhs, and Mahzbi Sikhs. Although in theory Sikhism
	does not have caste divisions, in fact and in practice, it does.
</p>

<h3>Concept of God and Spiritual Experience</h3>

<p>
	In the hymns of Guru Nanak, God is called
	&#8216;the Creator Person&#8217;, &#8216;Self-existent&#8217;,
	&#8216;Eternally True&#8217;, and &#8216;Guru&#8217;. He is both
	&#8216;Enlightener&#8217; and &#8216;Guide&#8217;-- He is benevolent
	and directs the world with His will. He is not only the Creator
	Person, but is also immanent in the world and is the Fount of all
	values and virtues, according to Nanak.
</p>

<p>The spiritual experience of the Guru further
	highlights that &#8216;He is All Love, and the rest He is
	ineffable.&#8217; The important aspect of this spiritual experience is
	that the Basic Reality (Sat), apart from being the Master of the
	creation, is guiding it with love. It is this spiritual experience of
	the Guru which determines the Sikh world-view: that the world is real,
	and not an illusion or maya. The bani (Sikh scripture) says,
	&#8216;True is He, True is His Creation. &rdquo; Also the fundamental
	Reality is deeply interested in guiding the world in all its
	spheres &ndash; spiritual and material, in fact barely making a
	distinction between these two aspects, which are mainly man-made.
</p>

<h3>Rejection of Asceticism</h3>

<p>
	Withdrawal, monasticism and asceticism are
	rejected by Guru Nanak&#8217;s teachings and instead, the
	householder&#8217;s life is embraced. He condemns the yogis for
	&#8216;being idlers, and not being ashamed of begging alms at the very
	door of the householder whose life they spurn.&#8217; He declares that
	&#8216;liberation is possible even while laughing and playing&#8217;
	and that &#8216;the God centered lives truthfully, while a
	householder.&#8217; Earlier Indian spiritual systems accept
	monasticism, asceticism or sanyasa, but according to Nanak God is
	&#8216;the Gracious Master of the entire universe and life&#8217; and
	faith in Him leaves the seeker no choice to select some aspects and
	leave others.
</p>

<p>	Interestingly Buddhism, Jainism as well as Islam
	and Christianity all consider the person who renounces the world to be
	the height of spirituality. In all these systems monasticism and
	withdrawal are encouraged as religious practices, and celibacy is a
	virtue. Some interpreters (Wendy Donniger, K Schomer and Kharak Singh)
	see this valorisation of renunciation, and the accompanying
	downgrading of women, as misogynist. With celibacy as the epitome of
	spirituality, woman becomes essentially a temptress, seducing men from
	their important spiritual pursuits. Guru Nanak himself, and all the
	Sikh Gurus with the exception of Guru Har Krishan, who died at a very
	early age, led a married householders life.
</p>

<p>A corollary of rejecting asceticism is that the
	seeker has to express his spirituality in virtuous activity and deeds.
	A follower of God&#8217;s Will, from this viewpoint, cannot remain a
	bystander in life. He has to work according to his capacity.
</p>

<h3>Resisting Oppression and Injustice</h3>

<p>
	Another responsibility which is expounded in
	Guru Nanak&#8217;s system, but which is new in the Indian context, is
	the spiritual person&#8217;s responsibility to resist and confront
	injustice and oppression. This responsibility found its logical
	conclusion in the martial figure of the Tenth Guru, Guru Gobind Singh
	who defended both Sikh and Hindu freedom to resist conversion and
	maintain their own religious identities.
</p>

<p>
	Unlike most saints and bhagats, he criticised in
	detail all the faults in the social, administrative, religious and
	political life of his times. He deprecated the hypocrisy, and greed of
	Pundits and Mullahs; the social discriminations and practices of
	pollution following cast prohibitions; the corruption and bribery
	practised by public functionaries; theluxurious life lived by the
	rulers; their oppression of the people and their failure to give
	security of life to their subjects.
</p>

<h3>Health Problems in Punjab</h3>

<p>
	According to the collaborating NGO, Voluntary
	Health Association of the Punjab, the abuse of alcohol and drugs is
	increasing in the state. Punjabis, particularly Sikhs, have always
	been stereotyped as hard working and hard drinking. But whether it is
	due to the years of turmoil and militancy in the state or the
	proximity to the Pakistan border across which heroin and other illegal
	drugs flow &ndash; substance abuse is rampant. As we travelled through
	the countryside our guide pointed out de-addiction centers. This abuse
	also leads to family economic crises and domestic violence.
</p>

<p>
	Sex determination tests are widely available,
	even in rural areas and female foeticide is not uncommon. Sons are
	considered of value because they carry o the family name, inherit and
	work the land. Dowry demands are on the rise, increasingly consumer
	items are desired, available and advertised. The need or desire for a
	son used to cause some families to have 10 girls &ndash; but now this is
	avoided, if the family has money, by aborting a female foetus. Dais
	claim they see problems resulting from repeated abortions. Private
	clinics and hospitals perform abortions on request. The sex ratio in
	Punjab is currently 883 females for every 1000 males and seems to be
	declining rather than rising.
</p>

<p>
	Patients taken to government dispensaries and
	hospitals by dais and health workers often get little co-operation
	from doctors. Lack of availability of essential medicines is also a
	problem faced in government health facilities. &ldquo;Quacks &rdquo;
	with questionable qualifications roam through villages selling
	antibiotics and other medications. Villagers buy and use these
	medicines for illnesses which are not considered emergencies as a
	&ldquo;real &rdquo; physician is expensive to see. It is often these
	&ldquo;quacks &rdquo; who are called to give injections during labour.
</p>

<h3>Matrika Workshop and Dais&#8217; Work</h3>

<p>
	The Matrika workshop was held on the Fategarh
	Sahib Gurdwara premises and drew dais from two underdeveloped blocks:
	Khera and Nandpur Kalod. Both of these blocks consist of 50% Majbi
	Sikhs (Harijan) and 50% Jat Sikhs. The dais are, of course, mainly
	Majbi. The organising NGO, VHAP, considered many areas of Punjab as
	location for the workshop and decided on this area because of its
	&#8216;backward&#8217; and underdeveloped status.
</p>

<p>
	Because of the proximity of Chandigarh and
	medical facilities available there many women from this area who go
	for institutionalised delivery if they have the resources. In fact
	dais reported that they were often paid more by the private nursing
	homes in the Chandigarh area to refer a case there, than they would
	receive if they, themselves, attended the birth at home!
</p>

<h3>VOLUNTARY HEALTH ASSOCIATION OF PUNJAB (VHAP)</h3>

<p>
	VHAP was established in 1993 with a goal of
	&ldquo;Making health a reality for the People of the Punjab &rdquo;. It
	is a state-level federation of Voluntary Organisations engaged in
	activities related to health and development at the grassroots level.
	VHAP is federated to the Voluntary Health Association of India, New
	Delhi. There are similar associations in most of the states of India.
	It strongly believes that attaining &#8216;health&#8217; is the
	responsibility of each individual and that the majority of illnesses
	can be prevented if all, both at the individual and society levels
	take proper care and attention.
</p>

<p>VHAP conducts workshops, training programs and seminars on:</p>
<ul>
	<li>community health and development</li>
	<li>health communications</li>
	<li>holistic health</li>
	<li>human resources development</li>
	<li>school health and mental health</li>
	<li>AIDs/HIV and STDs</li>
	<li>rational use of drugs and pesticides</li>
	<li>reproductive health</li>
	<li>environment and health</li>
</ul>

<p>
	VHAP also holds public campaigns and advocacy programmes; publishes
	and distributes health education materials.
