<p>
Ms Chawla started her working life in India teaching natural childbirth classes
to women and couples, helping them prepare for non-medicated, non-surgical birth.
Her frustration with the over-use of invasive obstetrical practices led her to begin
investigations of &lsquo;indigenous&rsquo; natural childbirth, Indian pregnancy
and birth traditions, and dais (traditional midwives).
</p>

Ms Chawla has researched, lectured and consulted on indigenous concepts of &lsquo;reproductive
health&rsquo; nationally and internationally. She is currently Director of MATRIKA,
an NGO active in research and advocacy for humane and traditional birth practice.

<h2>BRINGING BIRTH TO THE ARTS</h2>

<h3>Exhibition</h3>

<p>
Generated and produced MATRIKA exhibition &ldquo;Dharti Ma, Dai Ma: A Remix &rdquo;
(Earth Mother: Midwife Mother) drawing upon MATRIKA research and Indian cultural
imagery of the fertility of the female body and the earth. Habitat Visual Arts Gallery,
New Delhi (November 2004) Film Co-produced the film &lsquo;Born at Home&rsquo; (Video.
60 Minutes with English Subtitles) observes indigenous birth practices in parts
of North India. Poised between social reality and the eternal mystery of childbearing,
the film presents an intricate portrait of the dai (midwife) who is almost always
a low-caste, poor woman. The dais methods are holistic, conceiving of childbirth,
not as pathology but as continuation of organic life. Gender and class issues are
juxtaposed with the filming of the miracle of an actual birth. Sublunar films, Sameera
Jain director. Camera: Rita Banerjee, Editing: Monica Bhasin
</p>

<p>
The film has participated in the Margaret Mead festival in New York, the Mediawave
film and video festival in Hungary, the Film South Asia at Kathmandu and also the
